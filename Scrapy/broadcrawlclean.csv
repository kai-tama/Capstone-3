'Melissa Etheridge: My Window' review — a celebration of the singer's truest self,"Read our review of ', 'My Window', "", Grammy Award winner Melissa Etheridge's theatrical concert, playing at the Circle in the Square Theatre through November 19."", ""Melissa Etheridge is a Grammy- and Oscar-winning, globally successful rock star who, thanks to a folksy heartland sound and gritty, gravelly voice that sets her apart from her rock peers, still has the vibe of a hidden-gem indie artist. It's a contradiction she seems to be aware of and one that makes her theatrical concert, "", 'Melissa Etheridge: My Window', ', work.', 'No indie small-timer, of course, would get a two-month solo stint in a Broadway theatre to essentially narrate their Wikipedia biography and sing songs they assume many ticketholders will know the words to. But unlike ', 'Bruce Springsteen', ""'s 2017 Broadway concert (which inspired Etheridge's) at the cavernous "", 'St. James Theatre', "", Etheridge's gets the "", 'Circle in the Square', ', which is closer to a Brooklyn music hall than an arena. The singer even walks among the audience while flawlessly shredding on the guitar.', ""The venue admittedly does most of the heavy lifting in bringing audiences closer to Etheridge than ever before. Much of the information she shares about herself in the show's 2.5 hours — her upbringing in Kansas, lesbian-bar-singer-to-star arc, interest in alternative medicine, romantic relationships, personal tragedies — is readily available online. And in her attempt to hit all the major points in her 62 years of life, she and director Amy Tinkham speed through much of it. But fans will nonetheless enjoy hearing Etheridge's story from her own lips, and when she slows down and lets us — and herself — live in a moment and feel a feeling for a little while, "", 'My Window', ' is completely riveting.', 'Etheridge\'s memory of her first kiss is a highlight — with a fellow church girl with ""eyes of green with a brown streak like rust."" It\'s an innocent and tender excavation, not just a remembrance, of her wide-eyed teenage self. It\'s one of many romantic dalliances she recalls during ', 'My Window', "", which grow increasingly punchier, cheekier, and increasingly captivating if only because an older lesbian professing her truth and sexuality on stage is still something so rare. Another contradiction, considering that Etheridge reminds us her coming out in 1993 didn't derail her career — a statement that almost proves surprising (and educational) in 2023."", ""Her segments on the benefits of drugs and alternative medicine are, though also not rushed, less effective, as she takes a preachy rather than introspective tone. But luckily, no matter how overlong any bit of narration gets, Etheridge's next song saves the day."", 'From her best-known hits to the first song she ever wrote as a kid, each one soars, their poetic lyrics supplying the emotional depth the script sometimes misses. As a casual Etheridge fan, I left wanting to listen to each song over again and discover the rest, though the exhilarating experience of hearing her pour her desperation into ""I\'m the Only One,"" her fiery desire into ""I Wanna Come Over,"" and the full extent of her nimble guitar mastery into ""Bring Me Some Water"" live is something the recordings can\'t replicate. Those can only provide a window into the experience.', 'Melissa Etheridge: My Window', ' is at the Circle in the Square Theatre through November 19.

As a Black man, that’s a tall order. The church, like the town, is in the grip of racist tyrant Ol’ Cap’n Cotchipee.', 'Davis grew up in racially segregated Georgia. Like Purlie, Davis had first-hand experience with discrimination and bigotry, forces that inform the play and fueled his lifelong commitment to civil rights.

Just like for the venue’s former resident, ', 'A Doll’s House', ', the stage is bare. But the turntable used for that play is gone.', 'Edelman does the all spinning here as he displays his irresistible gift for storytelling, comedy, and capturing theatregoers’ undivided attention. This was my introduction to the show. Count me in as an instant admirer.', 'Edelman’s narrative approach recalls the comedian Mike Birbiglia, a producer here. Edelman shuns a straight line. He takes detours, roundabouts, cloverleafs, you name it. Still, his story feels seamless. Adam Brace, who died earlier this year, is credited as director. Alex Timbers is a creative consultant.', 'Edelman’s shirt, paired with plain pants and white sneakers, is fastened to the tippy top. But there’s nothing buttoned-up about him. He’s rarely still. He’s kinetic, crossing from one side of the stage to the other. He’s constantly raking his hand through his hair.', 'Comedy is about timing. He doesn’t rush to get to the main event in his story – that anti-Semitic meetup. Instead he begins with a seemingly arbitrary anecdote involving Robin Williams and a gorilla that learned American Sign Language. The point? The late celebrity’s comedy was so momentous it crossed “the species barrier.”', 'Edelman, meanwhile, claims his brand of humor is “so dumb and small.” It isn’t. At all. But it is very personal. It’s about his Jewishness, about his whiteness, about his family.', 'There’s a bit about his brother becoming a winter Olympian in the sport of skeleton, which he describes as combining an icy hill and a lunch tray. He recalls how his devout Jewish family celebrated Christmas for the sake of his mom’s friend. There’s a reference to growing up “in this really racist part of Boston called Boston.” Anti-vax friends also get their moment. As he mines and massages his life into funny business, it hits me: He’s ""The Marvelous Mr. Edelman.""', 'He eventually settles into how he responded to an online invitation to attend a meetup in New York City for folks questioning their whiteness. Turns out, no surprise, he was the lone Jewish person in the room.', ""Arriving at the Queens apartment where it was held, things seem benign enough. There are pastries and juice.

"'Back to the Future' review — 1.21 gigawatts of fun, heart, and spectacle","Read our four-star review of ', 'Back to the Future', ' on Broadway, the award-winning musical adaptation of the classic film playing at the Winter Garden Theatre.', 'If IMAX had taken off by 1985, ', 'Back to the Future', "" would have been its year's "", 'Oppenheimer', ': the kind of epic film you ', 'must', ' see in IMAX, or at least on the biggest screen you can find.

Unwittingly becoming one of humanity’s first time travelers and nearly wiping out your own existence by meddling in your parents’ meet-cute is, to quote Doc, “some serious shit.”', ""That's a lot for one teenager like Marty to handle — not to mention the ultimate terror of capturing his unknowing high-school-aged mother’s affections. And yet, "", 'Back to the Future', ' emerges, and continues to be regarded, as a funny, cult-classic romp. The musical adaptation, now on Broadway with 1.21 gigawatts of spectacle, honors all these views at once and gives ', 'Back to the Future', ' the larger-than-life presentation it deserves.', 'The design, naturally, does a lot of the heavy lifting.

Together with director John Rando's staging and Chris Bailey's athletic choreography that works the large ensemble for all it's got, the whole production is clearly eager, desperate even, to thrill you at every second. But to again quote Doc (and the title of his triumphant entrance song), it works."", 'On the topic of the songs, those mostly work, including timeless film favorites like ""The Power of Love"" and ""Johnny B.

Some are repetitive — not every song needs a reprise, and not every character needs a full-length ""I want"" number (or multiple) where a line or two of dialogue would suffice. It feels like a retroactive attempt to invest audiences in the characters, who get rather abruptly introduced at the start.', ""It's an odd paradox, that "", 'Back to the Future', "" assumes prior familiarity with the film such that the players need little introduction, while positing nearly every character as worthy of substantial exploration. Chalk it up, perhaps, to the fact that two of the movie's creators are involved: Bob Gale adapted the musical's book from his and Robert Zemeckis's screenplay, and Alan Silvestri, who composed the film score, co-wrote the musical's rollicking score with Glen Ballard. They clearly know and adore all their characters, but not all audiences have the same depth of understanding, especially 38 years on from the film's premiere."", ""But like the DeLorean climbing to the crucial 88 miles per hour, the writers ultimately succeed in building the show's momentum and narrative heft.

But the second star is Jacqueline E. Lawton, the production’s dramaturg on Broadway and at the Goodman Theatre, where it premiered last year. Lawton ensures that the show balances its dips into the fantastical with historical truths, a difficult tone deftly achieved in Lisa Peterson’s adroit production. If only Broadway would embrace the lobby display to immerse audiences even more in Oscar Levant’s world.', 'Set on one turbulent night of Levant’s life, ', 'Good Night, Oscar', ' sees Hayes not at the heyday of Levant’s career as a composer, pianist, and radio star, but as an ailing man struggling to control his addiction to the drugs his doctors have prescribed. The play tries to tackle the whole of Levant’s life in a few short scenes; a one-man show, like Wright’s Tony- and Pulitzer Prize-winning ', 'I Am My Own Wife', ', may have better suited the veneration of Levant’s talents and idiosyncrasies, channeling his alleged schizophrenia into different characters contained in one body.', 'But Hayes works best sparring with other actors, even if their characters aren’t fully developed. At one point, NBC president Bob Sarnoff (Peter Grosz) tries to cool Levant down: “The network feels —” to which Levant immediately interrupts, in a perfect distillation of the contemporary politics of corporate brands, “The network ', 'feels', '?”', 'Many characters exist only as devices: Fast-talking TV host Jack Paar (Ben Rappaport) upholds the play’s frame of ', 'The Tonight Show', ' and delineates entertainment and exploitation. June (Emily Bergl), Levant’s wife, though granted no interiority, grounds the piece in historicity, as she had Levant committed to psychiatric institutions multiple times over their marriage. Sarnoff is stiff and corny, mostly speaking in platitudes and warnings and dwarfed by Levant’s boisterousness.', 'Alvin Finney (Marchánt Davis), an orderly from the hospital where Levant is staying (and from which June has concocted an ill-advised escape so he may appear on TV), serves only as a reminder of Levant’s condition; his note that Levant’s old pal George Gershwin (John Zdrojeski) stole musical inspiration from Black New Yorkers is a too-brief insight that, absent any other political or social commentary, feels out of place in the script. Only Alex Wyse delights as the nervous Max Weinbaum, a nepotism-hire page desperate to win the approval of those in charge and move up the movie-making ladder.', ""Gershwin himself appears as a figment of Levant’s imagination, the boldest choice in the play that suffers from a lack of direction. He enters in smoke effects, whipping his coattails behind him like Dracula, a haunting manifestation of Levant's survivor’s guilt (over Gershwin’s early death at 38) and supreme performance anxiety. He would rather discuss Levant’s psychoses than modern music, which makes sense only because of his boxed existence in Levant’s mind, a reminder of all Levant has yet to achieve. The character could be a game-changer in "", 'Good Night, Oscar', ', more a guide than a ghost, but Zdrojeski plays him like a haunted house attraction.', 'With a less compelling performance from its lead, ', 'Good Night, Oscar', "" would fall flat. Its first half suffers from a lack of urgency; its second is burdened by hacky late-night antics. Almost everyone but Hayes’s Levant is forgettable in both performance and characterizations. Hayes is a marvel, embodying Levant in voice, spirit, physicality, and, eventually, music. He shakes like he’s davening prayer, fidgets like he's inebriated, and yells like his mind has left him without a choice."", 'Carolina Ortiz Herrera and Ben Stanton’s lighting design closes in on Levant as he hallucinates, fantasizes, and opines; these shifts, some subtle and some overt, call to mind the Brian Wilson biopic ', 'Love & Mercy', ', another exploration of both songwriting and schizophrenia.

(It earned two, including Best Revival of a Play.)', 'Lorraine Hansberry’s lengthy play was written before the attention span of the theatregoer was influenced by other media, but the length is no obstacle: If conversations run in circles in the Brustein apartment, it’s because real-world conversations of the personal and political sometimes run in circles. If the characters frustrate each other and the audience through self-sabotage, Hansberry lingers in this discomfort without progress on purpose.', 'Sidney Brustein — no longer an idealist but still a fighter, no longer a revolutionary but still moved by the plight of the common man — is not the sort of protagonist who speaks to move the plot forward. He doesn’t force revelations to the surface, but lets them arise naturally. He’s like a less suicidal Hamlet (another famed Isaac performance), shooting himself in the foot each time someone hands him a gun.', 'Sidney is annoying and self-righteous and insistent he doesn’t harbor the prejudices he so clearly carries (especially towards women, including Iris). Hansberry is not interested in placating the audience or in guiding them to a pre-determined conclusion with Sidney as surrogate — she just hands you the map. You have to decide if you’re going to get there, and how.', 'The beauty of Hansberry’s play almost makes up for Anne Kauffman’s production, which feels too unsure of itself to linger or make demands. Both Brosnahan and Isaac emit one-note performances that start high and strong but gradually deflate. Isaac, who is onstage almost the whole show, is at times charming and at times funny, but does not differentiate his performance enough through the first two acts. It is only in the third act’s devastation that Isaac finds something worth holding onto.', 'This third act brings both a foray into the surreal and the appearance of Gus Birney as Gloria, Iris’s younger sister who is hoping to marry Alton (Julian De Niro) and abandon her life as an escort. Birney’s wispy voice is perfect for the ethereal Gloria, whose presence may be an illusion in Kauffman’s more confident third act. Though the characters cavort on pills and find time slowing down, this portion of the play feels the most grounded.', 'Throughout, Iris and her sister Mavis (the hilarious Miriam Silverman, now a Tony nominee) have made all their choices based on Gloria’s, even if they don’t realize it. Gloria’s life as a sex worker, her drug use, and her depression bring the play into reality: Gone are the morality debates. What’s left is materiality, cold and sharp.', 'It is all the more disappointing, then, that the play’s first foray into the surreal, as Iris and Sidney play make-believe, falters. The scene is one of the only moments in which characters use the fire escape and balcony from Santiago Orjuela-Laverde, Andrew Moerdyk, and Kimie Nishikawa (the scenic design collective dots). The Brusteins’s playwright neighbor, David Ragin (Glenn Fitzgerald), often writes at his desk atop the main apartment like a guard in a watchtower. Kauffman gives him little else to do to show he is monitoring the Brusteins.', 'But maybe the Brusteins just aren’t as interesting as they think they are. Maybe this is the point. When she hears of David’s type of drama, Mavis bemoans that there aren’t more plays about ordinary people with ordinary problems. Despite Sidney’s more optimistic friends trudging up his dormant delusions of grandeur, ', 'The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window', ' is essentially that kind of play (though without the straight-edged naturalism the apartment dwellers deride).', 'Sidney and Iris’s dreams and disagreements are quotidian and their tragedies all too common, but this relatability does not diminish them or the text. It folds them into the body politic they debate and resist; it is the regular, normal people of Hansberry’s world who will have the chance to change it. Or perhaps they won’t.

"'New York, New York' review — Kander and Ebb musical is still searching for the very heart of it","Read our review of ', 'New York, New York', ' on Broadway, which is directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman and features new lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda.', 'There are neon marquee lights from days of old.

Unfortunately for ', 'New York, New York', ', now running on Broadway at the ', 'St. James Theatre', ', there isn’t much else.', 'Loosely based on Martin Scorsese’s 1977 film, ', 'New York, New York', ' follows a group of toxically optimistic performers trying to beat the odds and make it big in 1946. Francine Evans (Anna Uzele), a singer from Philly fresh off a USO tour, knows she will have to “work twice as hard to get half as far” in a segregated society.', 'Her love interest, Jimmy Doyle (a miscast Colton Ryan), believes Francine’s talent will override racial barriers. This idea comes up various times, expressed by white characters and characters of color, with the general conclusion that New York is special and different, a place with no discrimination.', 'Jimmy rebuffs Francine’s concerns over an interracial musical act with “This isn’t Texas. This is New York!” (The audience cheered.) Toward the end, Francine makes a career decision based on the racism and misogyny she’s experienced, and the characters take this as an offense against New York itself. “Don’t bet against New York,” one implores, as if her actions could possibly be construed that way.', 'Uzele’s Francine is the only character with a plot, and Uzele is the strongest performer. She carries the show as the self-sabotaging Jimmy grows to resent her success and recognition, leaving us without a reason to root for him. Her searing rendition of “But the World Goes Round” alone — during which projection designers Beowulf Boritt and Christopher Ash strip away the photorealistic backgrounds and leave Francine to bare her soul in a stark spotlight — outshines Ryan. His muffled voice doesn’t suit the broad and brassy Kander and Ebb numbers.', 'Ryan is done no favors, of course, by his character’s lack of plot or motive beyond landing Francine. We know he’s haunted by his past, but that doesn’t explain why he ambles about aimlessly until trumpet-playing veteran Jesse (John Clay III) and Cuban immigrant Mateo (Angela Sigala) hand him a second-act raison d’être. Characters in search of a plot, indeed.', 'Haranguing the show feels almost dirty, however, with Ebb long deceased and Kander now 96. (Lin-Manuel Miranda contributed additional lyrics, though his signature style is absent.) Theatregoers will recognize that Susan Stroman’s production, although it feels unfinished, is a love letter to the pair and their achievements in the genre. A revue would perhaps have been more appropriate than sticking half-developed characters with the songbook and hoping for the best.', 'At one point, a young violinist (Oliver Prose) tells his teacher, Madame Veltri (Emily Skinner, doing her best with little) that his whole family was murdered in Treblinka. She sings “A Simple Thing Like That” in response, a song about life’s randomness that, while pretty, doesn’t match the gravity of the moment.', 'If it were more cohesive, ', 'New York, New York', ' could be a great show for tourists (if they can stomach the disparagement of living anywhere else), complete with classic, tap-dancing tunes that employ a large number of dancers, designers, and musicians. But would it not serve both the company and audience more if the musical was a better-crafted tribute to Kander and Ebb and the city that made them?', 'The show concludes with the long-awaited title number, delivered by Uzele (with a delightful orchestral surprise) in unearned triumph.

In it, Tessa, a British barrister known for defending men accused of sexual assault, gets date raped herself. The parallels are plain.', 'Suzie Miller’s play offers a reckoning with the before and after. Only in the wake of her assault does Tessa fully wrap her brain around a terrible inequity. The symbol for justice is a woman, and in rape cases, her scales tip toward men. Unfortunately, that’s not exactly headline news.', 'Running 100 unbroken minutes, the production is Exhibit A of how a focused and fierce performance can elevate a work. Comer’s breathless star turn in her Broadway debut does that. Comer, who speaks for several minor characters, has won various awards for her portrait, including an ', 'Olivier', '. She is riveting, even in a late section where Tessa spouts statistics and the play teeters into movie-of-the-week territory.', 'Director Justin Martin keeps Tessa in near-nonstop motion on Miriam Buether’s set lined with soaring floor-to-ceiling case files. Tessa periodically climbs atop a heavy wooden table to make a point. It’s a stagy trick, but it gets attention.', 'Like Tessa, the production is alive. There’s a subtle heartbeat-like throb underscoring the action, incidental music, and bright flashes punctuating scenes thanks to sound designers Ben and Max Ringham, composer Rebecca Lucy Taylor, and lighting designer Natasha Chivers, respectively.', 'When we meet Tessa, she’s in court and at the top of her game. All smirks and smug self-satisfaction, she’s a shameless showboater in a robe and horsehair wig. She gleefully likens taking down a witness to a fight to the death. Armed with her legal cunning and killer instinct, she fires off questions that are aimed to slay, not just wound — bang-bang-bang! She shapes her fingers into a pistol as she revels.', 'When it comes to blasting holes in the testimony of an anguished woman alleging sexual assault, she is just as merciless. Tessa says she is in the business of legal truth — what’s provable beyond a doubt. It’s easy to connect the dots between Tessa and Villanelle, the ', 'Killing Eve', ' assassin that made Comer a star — and accounts for raucous entrance applause.', 'Tessa is in her element in court, but she’s far less so when she’s back home in hardscrabble Liverpool. A brief, fitful visit with her mother and brothers shows she’s left this world behind. Since landing a spot in law school at Cambridge, she’s moved on.', 'In London, she’s a star on the rise, whether in court drag or a flirty green dress for a date with Julian, a colleague she shags on a sofa at work. A week later, after drinks and sex earlier in the evening, Julian rapes Tessa in her home. The details spill out of her in a harrowing torrent echoed by an onstage rainstorm.', 'Tessa knows the law. Her case is iffy, but she decides to press charges. Some 782 days later, she has her day in court, where she knows she’ll be subjected to the same kind of attack she uses against witnesses. The outcome of the trial is fairly predictable. Tessa — who, by the way, is still a defense lawyer — seizes the opportunity to make a statement about the need for change.', 'In the end, Miller, an Australian writer with a law background, makes ', 'Prima Facie', ' a message play.

They’re a joy to watch in action – or, well, sitting. They’re both in chairs for practically the entirety of the show.', 'Seated at either end of a long rectangular table, the Ohio moms they play are a study in contrast. Diana (Linney) sports a black tee and pants, stylish loafers, and a strict curling-ironed coif. Alice (Hecht) is slightly slouchier and sports a patterned peasant dress, suede boots, and a loose, laid-back hairstyle.', 'Over the course of 100 intermissionless minutes, they flash back to America’s bicentennial – a time of independence and, it turns out, interdependence. Diana, an uptight single mom, made and taught art then. Alice, a free-spirited housewife, was married with a daughter. The women met through their kids. During a few months, their initial chilly mutual dislike melted into a warm and solid friendship.', 'Save for a surprise here and there, it’s pretty straightforward stuff. This show is all talk – but the women rarely speak to each other thanks to Auburn’s story structure. Diana and Alice recall their brief history in direct addresses to the audience. It’s as if they’re giving reality show testimonials. The nagging questions: Who are they supposed to be talking to, and why are these two telling this story now? We never really know.', ""The construction can’t help but have a distancing effect. But on the plus side, Auburn packs his script with humor, vivid and lived-in details, and lines that sometimes nail the way people talk. That includes Diana's tangy observation about Alice: “She just thought she was unconventional because her house was messy.”"", 'Over the summer, the bond between the women sneaks up on them amid ups and downs, laughs and arguments. They’re tugged closer together by everyday things like childcare and the subject of art, plus a major twist in Alice’s marriage to Doug, an Ohio State professor. When Doug comes into the picture, Diana speaks on his behalf.', 'Like summertime and lemonade, the two actresses are a great pair. Linney radiates smarts and her no-nonsense frankness is an ideal fit for Diana. Hecht, who never gives an ordinary stage performance, makes Alice likable and quirky.', 'Sullivan gives the actresses room to do what they do best while injecting an occasional direction to “stand up” and “sit back down.” Costumes by Linda Cho define characters, lighting Japhy Weideman suggests shifts in time, and an abstract backdrop of miniature squares by John Lee Beatty seems to seize inspiration from artist Paul Klee, who figures prominently in the story.', 'In the end, Diana and Alice reunite by chance at a New York museum decades after their initial meeting. Time goes on. Lives change. There’s an undeniable sweetness and melancholy in that simple reality.

After all, we could all desperately use a laugh right about now. Here are other reasons this show is just for you — and for everybody.', 'Solo stand-up comedy is about as perilous and elemental as theatre gets.

No fancy costume, just a basic shirt, pants, and sneakers. No special effects, just some lighting cues. No props, save for a tiny thingamajig (no spoiler!) to punctuate a key moment.', 'Edelman’s work is an object lesson in how to ace the challenge, and his signature idiosyncrasies are part of the appeal. He’s constantly on the move, shifting from one side of the stage to the other like a target in an arcade game. His restless energy is contagious.', 'The heart of the show beats around an anecdote that’s so nutty – if not risky for someone who’s Jewish – it has to be true. Edelman builds the piece around the time he attended a meeting of white supremacists in Queens, New York.', 'The get-together begins benignly. He tucks into refreshments. He shares a meet-cute moment with a young woman that almost – just almost – makes him forget that she’s a bigot. The group discussion naturally turns racist. All the while he listens, feeling empathy, if not sadness, for the company he’s keeping.', 'That changes when his identity comes out and he lands in the hot seat. Unsettling? You bet. And he mines it for every bit of humor.', 'Edelman’s show, directed by his late collaborator Adam Brace, is an invigorating reminder that how you tell a story matters just as much as the tale itself.

This new fairytale is the Broadway musical "", 'Once Upon a One More Time', ', a spectacle powered by the song catalog of the Princess of Pop: Britney Spears.', 'Once Upon a One More Time', ' is certainly not the first piece of media interested in putting a modern, empowering spin on fairytales — even the notion of the ""strong independent princess"" has become a tale as old as time.

Fairytale characters lie in wait until a child chooses to read their stories, at which point the  Narrator summons them to live out the same tales over and over. ""We do not make fairytales, we follow them,"" he repeatedly insists.', ""The princesses' newfound desire for change comes from Betty Friedan's 1963 book "", 'The Feminine Mystique', "", which The Notorious O.F.G. (Original Fairy Godmother, played by Brooke Dillman in eccentric-aunt fashion) bestows on the princesses' book club. Given that setup, one shouldn't expect a revelatory feminist story from "", 'Once Upon a One More Time', "": Friedan's book kicked off second-wave feminism, and Friedan famously excluded queer women from her movement, both long outdated notions by today's intersectional, fourth-wave standards."", 'A hastily drawn gay subplot and cursory nods to modern women\'s annoyances (through lines like ""You\'re so much prettier when you smile,"" which elicited loud noises of disgust from my audience) come off as Hartmere\'s attempts to offset these concerns. Luckily, Friedan doesn\'t factor heavily into the musical (until the end, which contains a revelation that unwittingly invites the audience to root for her) — just the general notion that she wrote about women wanting to escape rigid, societally prescribed roles.', ""But like I said, if you're willing to accept "", 'Once Upon a One More Time', ' as a kind of period piece in which feminism is new, you\'ll have a fantastic time, because there is still plenty to unequivocally love.

The Madrids are choreographers first, and it shows — their hip-hop- and '90s music video-flavored moves tell a story. The princes dance with unabashed swagger from the start, taking up the whole stage with confidence. The princesses' moves begin small and ultra-precise, almost stilted, but have an underlying sharpness that suggests a fierceness inside them. Their choreography gradually gets bigger and freer — that is, more like the men's — as they tap into that fierceness and find their independence."", 'Among the large ensemble cast, Justin Guarini is the undisputed standout as the womanizing Prince Charming. He gets two of Britney\'s biggest songs — ""Circus"" and ""Oops!...I Did It Again"" — and delivers them in full rockstar mode to make them the show\'s best numbers alongside ""Toxic."" Guarini and Simard deliver both the vocal power and impeccable comic timing (Simard\'s Stepmother is giving Jennifer Coolidge) — her commanding entrance during ""Work Bitch"" is one to behold. Among the princesses, Briga Heelan and Aisha Jackson are wonderfully poised as Cinderella and Snow White.', ""Though it's not the focus, the show does have one feminist element worth noting.

That question is at the core of ', 'Life of Pi', ', a fantastical fable about survival, faith, and how stories help us make sense of our lives.', 'Visually, the play is a deeply wondrous spectacle that teems with beauty and brutality. Narratively, the script does less to impress, as if written at times in magic marker, and supporting performances could use some shading. Bottom line for this work on Broadway following runs in London and Cambridge, Massachusetts: The display’s the thing.', 'Based on Yann Martel’s 2001 novel that spawned an Oscar-winning movie, Lolita Chakrabarti’s stage version begins in 1978 in a hospital room in Mexico. Pi Patel (Hiran Abeysekera, captivating) is questioned by representatives of the Canadian Embassy (Kirstin Louie) and Japanese Ministry of Transport (Daisuke Tsuji). They’re after facts on how the Tsimtsum, a cargo ship bound for Canada, sank eight months earlier – and how Pi defied death. He tells them.', 'The action moves between the infirmary, Pi’s home, and the middle of the ocean. In 1976 Pondicherry, India, happy-go-lucky Pi’s life in a zoo comes into focus through a series of bite-sized scenes. Butterflies dance in the air, and a giraffe cranes its graceful neck. We meet his zookeeper parents (Rajesh Bose and Mahira Kakkar) and sister (Sonya Venugopal), as well as a zebra, orangutans, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, ', 'brought to life by puppets', ' and multiple puppeteers.', ""Each beast is dangerous, a point Pi’s father makes by sacrificing a goat to the tiger. (Note: This is not a kids' show.) The scene shifts to a bustling marketplace, where spiritually inquisitive Pi looks to leaders at a local church, mosque, and temple for answers to his big questions. “If God is good and kind, why is there so much violence in the world?” he asks."", 'Political unrest compels Pi’s family to leave India with their animals for Canada aboard the Tsimtsum. About 40 minutes into the play, there’s a cry of “Storm coming!” and everything changes. The ship sinks, and from the bare stage, a small lifeboat magically surfaces like a sea creature. Pi climbs into the craft, and he’s not alone. An orangutan, hyena, injured zebra, and Richard Parker have busted out of containers and taken refuge there.', 'Eventually, only Pi and the tiger remain. To outlast the maneater, he tames the beast and reconciles with its killer instinct – and his own, after going against his beliefs and eating a sea turtle to avoid starvation. When the government investigators in Mexico doubt his tale, Pi spins a parallel yarn – minus animals but with human predators instead.', 'What’s the takeaway? Maybe it’s as simple as to never give up – and everything that conveys. While lost at sea, Pi talks with the ghost of his sister, who can’t believe he still has faith. “Look at where you are,” she says. “But I’m alive,” Pi responds.', 'In the end, there’s no question that director Max Webster’s staging is a technical marvel that makes the most of its moving parts. Those include amazing puppetry; evocative scenic, lighting, and sound design; and transporting video and animation effects that conjure the ocean and the sky above.', '“My story will make you believe in God,” Pi insists.

Sweeney (Groban) returns to London after being wrongfully imprisoned for 15 years. Mourning the loss of his family because of a corrupt judge and his henchman, the barber swears revenge on the duo. He’ll use his straight razors for payback. Pie shop proprietor Mrs. Lovett (Ashford), who has a thing for Sweeney, becomes his accomplice. When Sweeney’s throat-slitting escalates, she grinds his victims into makings for meat pies. Business booms. But there’s no way this tale can have a happy ending.', 'Mimi Lien’s two-tiered set makes use of the stage and a bridge above it. A counter pushed into place is the pie shop, and a crane contraption doubles as a madhouse. The bridge is used in a striking moment for a silhouetted dance. Elsewhere, Steven Hoggett’s choreography recalls awkward aerobics, particularly when all hell breaks loose near the end. Natasha Katz’s dramatic lighting is the star of the physical production.', 'Both leads deliver exactly what they’re best at. Groban, a Tony nominee for ', 'Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812', ', has a nice-guy persona and lacks the sinister side to convince as a man ""even rats fear,"" according to the title song. He also blends into the crowd in group scenes. But when he sings, Groban commands focus 100 percent. He taps directly into the mournful tones of “The Barber and His Wife,” in which he recalls his past, and the despair of “Epiphany,” as he faces his future.', 'Last seen on Broadway as Dot in Sondheim’s ', 'Sunday in the Park With George', ', Ashford is a very fine singer, but her comic chops set her apart. She won a Tony for ', 'You Can’t Take It With You', ', a play in which she bounced off the walls. She is clearly in her comfort zone here.', 'Sporting a messy hairdo a la Angela Lansbury, the original Mrs. Lovett, Ashford throws herself into the part – and onto the stage.

Webber uses the song as a leitmotif throughout his adaptation, setting the notes to his protagonist’s confession that she is “bad” and “wild and free.” This bold choice invites instant comparisons to Cinderellas past and reveals the depths that Laurence Connor’s production at the ', 'Imperial Theatre', ' lacks.', 'Set in the fictional French town of Belleville, ', 'Bad Cinderella', ' follows a rule-breaking heroine (Linedy Genao) who rejects the city’s obsession with physical beauty. She spray-paints “Beauty Sucks” on a statue of Prince Charming (Cameron Loyal), who went missing a year ago in his quest to slay a dragon. This is the most rebellious action she takes throughout the show, preferring instead to stare off into the forest and ponder her helplessness. Cinderella is angry that life took away her parents and left her with a cruel Stepmother (Carolee Carmello, a highlight of the production) and dimwitted stepsisters Adele (Sami Gayle) and Marie (Morgan Higgins). However, she never tries to change her situation, fight for the little guy, or better her society.', 'The most fruitful premise in ', 'Bad Cinderella', ' is that Cinderella and her prince don’t fall in love at first sight at the ball. Instead, she and Prince Sebastian (Jordan Dobson, who we are supposed to believe is ugly) are childhood friends, bonded by a feeling of never fitting in. This choice promises a deeper love story the show does not deliver, as the characters spend little time together and are denied a triumphant finale.', 'Prince Sebastian feels awkward around the imposing Hunks of the castle’s inner circle and detests the notion that he must marry for political gain. His older brother feels pressured to conform to the crown’s expectations and chooses to defy them for love. The princes are granted an interiority that is never extended to Cinderella, relegating her to second billing in her own musical.', 'Bad Cinderella', "" premiered in the U.K. in 2021 with a libretto by Emerald Fennell; the Broadway production features additional book material by Alexis Scheer. The book overrelies on jokes about women's relationships to their bodies. “I want to be hot,” Cinderella, who has until now just wanted to get by unscathed, sings to the Godmother (Christina Acosta Robinson, who has nothing to do). When Marie says she wants to look “lean and mean,” her mother tells her she’s “halfway there, just overweight.”"", 'The show’s mantra of “beauty is our duty” is never interrogated; there is no counter, just a bland pronouncement that Sebastian likes Cinderella the way she is. This result is puzzling coming from Fennell, who won an Oscar for a polarizing feminist revenge fantasy film, and Scheer, who made her name with a play about the inner lives of teenage girls.', 'This may be an unfair characterization of the creative process, however. It’s possible that Fennell and Scheer were never in a room together, let alone one with Lloyd Webber and lyricist David Zippel, which may explain the lack of cohesion.', 'Musically, the show tries to blend musical theatre and rock opera and instead trades off genres each song. The best song in the show is “I Know You,” a duet between the dueling Stepmother and Queen (Grace McLean, who deserves her flowers). The progression of their froufrou cupcake dresses from costume and scenic designer Gabriela Tylesova is also a treat.', 'But despite McLean’s humorous victories, ', 'Bad Cinderella', ' does not live up to its potential to deliver an empowering thesis.

The rock song’s moody lyrics about searching for masculinity and self-worth are fitting for Hamlet — and his Black, gay derivative.', 'This riff on the Bard’s tragedy takes place at a backyard barbecue in the South. Juicy (Marcel Spears) and his family are celebrating the nuptials of his mother Tedra (Nikki Crawford) to his Uncle Rev (Billy Eugene Jones), just one week after the murder of his father Pap (also Jones). Sound familiar?', 'Fat Ham', ' ', 'isn’t a scene-for-scene adaptation of the tragedy', ', though. The 95-minute play begins with Tio (played with hilarity by Chris Herbie Holland) casually watching porn on his cell phone as Juicy resentfully decorates the backyard. The smoking barbecue grill, colorful globe lights, and bunches of balloons look like harbingers of a happy celebration — but Pap’s ghost has other plans.', 'Pap, dressed in a white suit and covered in a red-checkered tablecloth, appears to Juicy to exhort vengeance.

And he isn’t sure he’s capable — or willing — to exact bloody revenge.', 'Juicy sports a bedazzled “Mama’s Boy” shirt, but Tedra, wearing bedazzled booty shorts, is unable to give Juicy the love and support he needs. She makes matters worse when she tells him she spent his college tuition fund on a bathroom renovation.', 'Under Saheem Ali’s direction, all the characters move between tenderness and toughness with ease. The back and forth is thrilling, and the audience even becomes part of this energy with occasional fourth-wall breaks.', 'The strongest performances are from the young characters, who have more self-awareness than their Shakespearean counterparts. Spears plays Juicy with a gentle, exacting power that might make the audience think he is capable of butchering his uncle — or maybe he just wants to change the family legacy. Opal (Adrianna Mitchell) is a headstrong Ophelia that moves to the beat of her own drum. Holland gets a scene-stealing soliloquy, in which a stoned Tio recalls receiving fellatio from a gingerbread man while playing a VR game.', 'The play’s brilliance is in its ability to tie Shakespeare into this contemporary family’s experience, even if the characters don’t see it. When Juicy quotes a line from ', 'Romeo & Juliet', ', Tedra accuses him of watching too much PBS. “If you bring up that dead old white man one mo time…” she warns. There are plenty more references to ', 'Hamlet', ', including the perfectly delivered line “there’s the rub” (pulled from the famous ""to be or not to be"" monologue) and a brief aside in verse to set up a game of charades. And when Tio tells Juicy their former classmate Yorick overdosed, Juicy cradles a smiley-face balloon instead of a skull.', 'Throughout the play, others repeatedly call Juicy “tender” and “soft.” “You was powerful when you were a baby,” Rev says. “And you got soft. And you was nothing like your daddy or like me. You was soft. And the men in our family ain’t soft.”', 'But maybe tender is good. (Tender pork ribs sure are.) Ijames takes Hamlet’s political and social themes and marinates them for a modern audience. There’s no crown to transfer here, just generations of toxic masculinity to pass down and homophobia to unpack.', 'Fat Ham', ' is less about seeking revenge and more about Juicy winning justice.

We can't expand what flies as Broadway theatre if no one dares to try. This Kenny Leon-directed production is imperfect, but it deserves credit for trying and for what it gets right, including McDonald's riveting lead performance."", 'Ohio State Murders', "", which features one of Kennedy's more linear plots, is a good choice for testing the waters.

Well, since she asked, I’d like a new Broadway musical comedy that’s a bracing, fizzy cocktail garnished with a winning cast.', 'Happily, this lavish show based on the Oscar-winning 1959 Billy Wilder classic rom-com mostly delivers that. Screen-to-stage adaptations are always tricky endeavors, and this one scores points for not just tracing the source but turning up some fresh ideas of its own.', 'If only director and choreographer Casey Nicholaw wasn’t so bent on selling nearly every song and tap dance number so relentlessly and formulaically hard. A mob hit sets the plot in motion, and the operative word in his staging is overkill. Some like it hot, sure, but not constantly. The production needs more room to breathe.', 'Despite that reservation, there’s still a lot to like. There’s a batch of buoyant songs by Marc Shaiman (music and lyrics) and Scott Wittman (lyrics), pros at matching showtunes to a particular period. In ', 'Hairspray', ', the team welcomed us to the ’60s. Their latest jazzy, horn-happy score whisks us back to 1933. Not every song leaves such a lasting impression as the juicy title number, but they all set the scene and flesh out characters.', 'Bookwriters Matthew Lopez (', 'The Inheritance', ') and Amber Ruffin (', 'A Black Lady Sketch Show', ') have packed the story with laughs as we follow saxophonist Joe (', 'Christian Borle', ') and stand-up bassist Jerry (J. Harrison Ghee). The lifelong pals find themselves in mortal danger after witnessing a gangland execution in Chicago.', 'The friends hatch a do-or-die plan to dress in drag and reinvent themselves — Joe becomes Josephine, Jerry morphs into Daphne. They hustle their way into a women’s touring band led by Sweet Sue (NaTasha Yvette Williams) that’s headed to the West Coast.', 'Once they get to San Diego, they’ll make a break for Mexico. But obstacles arise — namely Sugar (Adrianna Hicks), the band’s lead singer who catches Joe’s eye; Osgood (Kevin del Aguila), a soda pop titan crushing on Daphne; and Spats (Mark Lotito), the mob boss out to off the witnesses.', 'To his credit, Nicholaw sees to it that each scene is composed like a movie still, and the design team lends invaluable support. Scott Pask’s sets are picture-perfect, Gregg Barnes’ costumes reek period chic, and Natasha Katz’s shifting lighting sets the mood.', 'One gorgeous moment begins on a train and cleverly dissolves into a club in near-cinematic fashion, all while Sugar belts a torchy tune. A baggage car scene where Sugar reveals her big-screen dreams to Josephine becomes improbably beautiful.', 'Borle is a hoot in the role made famous onscreen by Tony Curtis.

', 'Parade', ', back in a banner revival, sees its stars ', 'Ben Platt', ' and Micaela Diamond work that special magic twice with a pair of duets, one hopeful and one crushing. Memo: Bring tissues.', 'First (and last) seen on Broadway in 1998, this unflinchingly dark show by composer-lyricist Jason Robert Brown and writer Alfred Uhry – who each won a Tony for their toils – was sparked by infamous true events. The late Harold Prince, who directed the premiere, is credited here as a co-conceiver.', 'In 1913 Marietta, Georgia, Leo Frank (Platt), a 29-year-old Jewish factory supervisor from Brooklyn, was wrongfully arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death for allegedly killing Mary Phagan, a 13-year-old employee of his. After years of appeals, Frank’s sentence was commuted to life in prison, but he was lynched by a vigilante mob.', 'That might not strike you as a story that sings. But ', 'Parade', ' reminds us that musicals have unlimited capacity for stories; it’s all in the telling. Despite the cumbersome first act, Brown and Uhry tell a gripping story wrapped in a beautiful and richly varied score.', 'Moreover, nearly 25 years after the show’s debut, the themes it covers – anti-Semitism, media sensationalism, judicial corruption, and mob violence among them – throb with up-to-the-second resonance. It’s a musical in which powerful people advance a narrative and manipulate others — and facts — to fit it. Like yesterday’s headlines, no?', 'Director Michael Arden’s excellent revival arrives on Broadway fresh from a New York City Center run in November. The cast is mostly intact, and the physical production remains essentially the same. Susan Hilferty’s costumes are buttoned up in period detail, while lighting designer Heather Gilbert bathes the stage in a moody glow.', 'Dane Laffrey’s set features a raised platform with chairs on two sides. Scenes move seamlessly from the Frank residence to factory to courtroom to jail cell to Confederate Memorial Day parade and beyond. Exposed theatre walls become the blank canvas for projection designer Sven Ortel’s images that define interior and exterior locations.', 'Photographs also appear to identify the real-life characters connected to the Frank case. Besides lending a docudrama vibe, the pictures lend clarity to the sprawling who’s who. There’s a parade of scheming politicians, bigoted journalists, corrupt prosecutors, witnesses who lie through their teeth, and others. It takes a village to railroad a scapegoat.', 'The photo IDs are smart moves by Arden, although not every choice is quite as well-judged. A courtroom section that shifts into slow motion is a head-scratcher. The specter of Mary Phagan perched on a swing in midair is an odd and heavy-handed idea that reaps no payoff.', 'Fortunately, the uniformly terrific cast makes up for small-scale quibbles. Standout supporting work comes from Sean Allan Krill as the honorable Governor Slaton; Alex Joseph Grayson as Jim Conley, whose testimony nails Leo; Paul Alexander Nolan as the rabid prosecutor; and Jake Pedersen as Mary’s boyfriend.', 'Leo and Lucille’s evolving relationship forms the heart of the show, and both stars deliver in performances that are authentically life-size — no larger — and that is key to this story.

'Pictures From Home' review — family drama captures the challenges of art and mortality,"Read our four-star review of Sharr White's "", 'Pictures From Home', ' starring Nathan Lane, Danny Burstein, and Zoë Wanamaker, playing at Studio 54 on Broadway.', '“I’m exploring.” That’s what the acclaimed photographer Larry Sultan tells his parents in ', 'Pictures From Home', ', a surprisingly touching new play based on his 1992 photo memoir of the same name.', 'It’s 1982. Larry (', 'Danny Burstein', '), a married father of two who lives in San Francisco, is explaining plans for his new art “project” to his mom and dad, Jean and Irving (Zoë Wanamaker and ', 'Nathan Lane', '), in their southern California home. Larry’s exploration will ultimately take ten long years to complete. They’ll be part of it every step of the way.', 'During that decade, Larry obsessively combs through 30 years of the family’s vintage home movies and snaps countless candids and meticulously arranged pictures of his parents. His bottomless curiosity about Irv and Jean turns the aging couple’s lives inside out. “What I’m doing,” says Larry, “is looking for the life beyond the frame.”', 'Playwright Sharr White (', 'The Other Place', ') finds similar narrative inspiration for this rich drama about the marvels and mysteries of an ordinary family. (It’s a selective portrait – Larry’s two brothers are mentioned in passing, and that’s it.) White looks beyond content in Sultan’s book to imagine inevitable behind-the-scenes small- and large-scale dramas drummed up by Larry’s posing and probing. Art isn’t easy – just ask these accommodating parents with lives of their own.', 'From the jump, it’s obvious White isn’t taking a realistic route. Larry periodically breaks the fourth wall (as do his parents) and summons an invisible projectionist to roll homemade family films and cue up pictures, as if he’s giving a photography lecture back at California College of the Arts. Scene-setting text projections – “Terminal A,” “The Silent Treatment,” “Departures” – pop up in the unbroken 105-minute production as the action shifts in time and location.', 'Under Bartlett Sher’s assured direction, all three actors deftly capture the play’s shifting tones. Burstein shines as Larry, an artist whose work may not always be in his parents’ best interests. Wanamaker’s Jean is happily resigned to her life, but she’s nobody’s fool. Irv, a salesman-turned-executive unceremoniously pushed into retirement, emerges as a fascinating figure. Credit Lane’s depiction that toggles back and forth from funny to poignant in a flash.', 'A striking aspect of Sher’s production is that the actors aren’t lookalikes for the people they’re playing. Lane and Burstein are nearly the same age. It’s a play about memories, after all, so there’s distance between how people are seen and how they really are. Early on, Larry claims the story “isn’t about me, it’s about them.” Irv drolly responds, “Larry may say it’s about us, but trust me. It’s about him.” Perhaps the casting lends wiggle room. If you’ve ever had questions or concerns about your parents, perhaps it’s about you, too.', 'Irv calls the project an ""investigation,"" questioning whether Larry’s staged pictures reveal anything authentic and wondering why he’s spending so much time away from his own family. The play considers that Larry’s motive wasn’t just about exploring. It was also about exploding myths and images suggesting a storybook life.', 'As in any play about a family, White covers expected territory about generational divides, legacies, mortality, and finally, love. Eventually, a clear picture develops about what was driving Larry’s parent-focused project. It was to “stop time,” he says. “I want you to live forever.” But even beyond the frame, time ticks on.', 'Pictures From Home', ' is at Studio 54.

"'Topdog/Underdog' review — with Corey Hawkins and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, this play shows its lasting power","Back on Broadway in a top-notch new production, Suzan-Lori Parks’s 2002 Pulitzer Prize winner, ', 'Topdog/Underdog', ', bubbles over with timeless talking points. The always intriguing playwright reckons with race, identity, fractured families, and the elusive chase for grace. At its core – and right there in the title – the play also concerns power. Someone’s always got more of it, and that disparity breeds trouble.', 'For this harrowing and humorous two-hander to reach its full firepower, it takes actors equal in might. Director Kenny Leon has cast a pair of aces who consistently match each other across the tragicomic tone shifts.', 'Broadway rookie Yahya Abdul-Mateen II went nude in his Emmy-winning ', 'Watchmen', ' role, but he’s never been more emotionally naked than in his performance as Booth. He nails the recklessness — and in the end, raw sorrow — of the brash younger brother. And Corey Hawkins, a Tony nominee for ', 'Six Degrees of Separation', ', gives a star turn that’s persuasively measured and lived-in as big brother Lincoln.', 'Beyond their ripely symbolic, larger-than-life names, these young Black men share traumatic histories (“raggedy recollections,” as one puts it), uncertain futures, and inevitable fates. The setting, according to the program, is here, and the time is now. Those narrative details manage to be both specific and all over the map.', ""Arnulfo Maldonado's set also goes more than one way. The depiction of Booth’s residence, a room in an urban boarding house, is down-to-earth in its claustrophobic shabbiness. But beyond its walls are visible swoops of gold drapery, suggesting something less realistic, somewhere shiny and out of reach."", 'Booth squeaks by from what he can “boost.” He’s convinced con games are the way to economic opportunity and a step up from shoplifting. He needs cash to win over Grace, a woman this dreamer-schemer claims loves him, “but she don’t know it yet.” He clumsily rehearses moves and patter for three-card Monte on an improvised table of milk crates and cardboard. Booth wants to team up in the scam with Lincoln, a former badass at “throwing cards.”', 'Since quitting the con and getting kicked to the curb by his wife – a crushing blow that involved Booth – Lincoln has made a living by dying. He wears whiteface and a ratty frock beard, frock coat, and top hat to pose as Abraham Lincoln in an arcade, where people pay money to pretend to kill the 16th president. It’s a job out of a strange nightmare – if not the musical ', 'Assassins', '.', 'It’s pointedly grim stuff. But Parks pulls spiky laughs from the bleak circumstances. Convinced his cost-cutting bosses will replace him (how’s that for an evergreen subject), Lincoln exaggeratedly polishes Honest Abe’s death scene to grin-inducing effect. Similarly, Booth gleefully savors the spoils of a busy day of stealing suits – one for him, one for Lincoln.', 'But the brotherly love only extends so far. The siblings’ inability to come together on the card con scheme, and a plot twist involving a family inheritance, sets the stage for calamity. When someone has next to nothing, losing that can only lead to extremes.', 'This production establishes its tone before it begins. A massive Old Glory looms large and conveys a weighty sense of history. ', 'Topdog/Underdog', ' does that, too, in its own theatrical way.

'Almost Famous' review — musical adaptation of hit film doesn't rock as hard,"Cameron Crowe’s musical adaptation of his much-loved 22-year-old Oscar-winner, ', 'Almost Famous', ', gets off to a very promising start. So much so you silently hope Crowe (book and lyrics), Tom Kitt (music and lyrics), and director Jeremy Herrin can sustain the high level for the whole 2.5 hours. Long story short, no such luck.', 'Fortunately, the show is filled with fine performances and getup that takes us back a half-century without looking like a costume party. The energizing early vignettes come packed with rockers, groupies, backstage bustle, swirling doorways, blazing stage lights, flared jeans, macrame halter tops and crocheted hot pants. We know the time, the place, who’s who, and what’s at stake.', 'In California circa 1973, socially awkward 15-year-old William Miller (Casey Likes) is aching to be seen and heard. He plans to make that happen, like Crowe did, as a music journalist. He lands an assignment for Rolling Stone to cover Stillwater, an up-and-coming group behind the scratchy hit “Fever Dog.” Guitarist Russell Hammond (Chris Wood) has the skills, voice, mystique, and long hair (parted down the middle) of a star.', 'William’s rigid widowed mom (Anika Larsen, channeling Frances McDormand from the film) reluctantly gives him the green light to go. William quickly discovers onstage rock gods are just self-serving neurotics behind the scenes.', 'Up to this point, the focus is squarely on William, who does everything he can to make his dream happen. He pesters the esteemed rock critic Lester Bangs (Rob Colletti). He charms Russell and frontman Jeff Bebe (Drew Gehling, game for anything). He befriends Penny Lane (an iridescent Solea Pfeiffer, in the role made famous by Kate Hudson), who favors the term “band aid” to ""groupie"" and recklessly prefers Russell over everyone else.', 'William stays busy. And then… he turns passive. He becomes just another person in the room, the one with the tape recorder. Things that happen between Russell and Penny and within Stillwater have nothing to do with William. Without a strong focus, the story falls slack and meanders.', 'Even when it’s blurry, ', 'Almost Famous', ' has smart things to say about the power of music, weirdness of celebrity, force of family, and bittersweetness of life. It’s also a love story – a few of them. There’s William and Penny, Penny and Russell, and, more subtly, Crowe and pop legend Joni Mitchell. He’s seen to it that she looms large in the show. A tiny fragment of her achy ballad, “River,” plays in the background onscreen. The musical turns it into a lyrical point of connection. “Call me if you ever need a rescue, or a river to skate away on,” Penny tells William. “‘River.’ Joni Mitchell,” he responds. Later in the show it becomes their dramatic duet.', 'Showcasing the song and its peerless poetry on stage is a bold move. The same goes for Elton John’s irresistible “Tiny Dancer,” which the Stillwater band members sing in the movie and show as they mend fences. Music heals. They’re great songs, of course, and that cuts two ways.', 'New songs by Crowe and Kitt (', 'Next to Normal', ') are easy on the ears but don’t quite rise as high. “1973,” which begins as a solo for Likes and builds into a rousing group number, is a lively show opener. “Morocco,” sung beautifully by Pfeiffer, expresses Penny’s desires and, like the character, is pretty but vague. “The Night-Time Sky’s Got Nothing on You,” a duet between Russell and Penny, is a vocal highlight.', 'In the end ', 'Almost Famous', ' is a mid-level musical that lives up to its title.

In 1999 New Jersey, Kim has an extremely rare condition causing her to age at more than four times the normal speed. She just celebrated her 16th birthday, and in doing so, she’s turned the corner on her life expectancy.', 'There’s more. Her dad, Buddy (Steven Boyer), hits the bottle with alarming regularity.

Her aunt Debra (Bonnie Milligan) is a con woman who only looks out for herself.', 'Kim finds a friend and an escape in Seth (Justin Cooley), a geeky fellow student who is obsessed with anagrams and, like her, has a dicey home situation. They initially come together for an ill-conceived science class project, but their bond grows deeper. Around Seth, this girl who looks like she’s 72 can actually act just like the 16-year-old she is.', 'Black comedy is tricky to pull off. How do you balance the bitter with the sweet? Specifically, how do you find the humor in a distressing subject matter of a teen whose death is coming at her at warp speed?', 'The creators succeed with a story that goes to serious and seriously cockamamie places (cue Debra’s nutty check-fraud scene) and a batch of songs that are rich, melodic, and multi-toned. There’s also an ace in the hole – Seth and Kim are the most irresistible odd couple since Harold and Maude.', 'As scenes shift from a skating rink to Kim’s home and school and beyond, the show spills over with heart, hilarity, hummable songs, and an evergreen, urgent message to live every day like it’s your last. In keeping with the go-for-it attitude, the whole cast makes the most of every minute.', 'Tony winner Clark (', 'The Light in the Piazza', ') delights as the smart, resilient, and gutsy Kim, who realizes wishes can’t make things better – but she can.

These include his dangerous sleep disorder (', 'Sleepwalk with Me', '), bad dates (', 'My Girlfriend’s Boyfriend', '), and parenting perils (', 'The New One', ').', 'Director and longtime collaborator Seth Barrish stages ', 'The Old Man and the Pool', ' simply. Birbiglia wears blue street clothes and stands before a giant curved wall, designed by Beowulf Boritt, that recalls a pool and briefly doubles as a slip-and-slide.', 'The story begins with a single breath that sets off recollections that dip in and out of the present. In his trademark style, Birbiglia packs his narrative with flashbacks, curlicues, non sequiturs, and one-liners. The story is here, there, everywhere. It’s how he rolls, and he overall ties things up, save for a few loose ends.', 'Firstly, a doctor’s test reveals Birbiglia has inherited his family’s cardiac issues. His dad and granddad both suffered heart attacks in their 50s. Physicians naturally advise him to eat healthy and swim regularly. Yeah, right. He gobbles pizza by the pie, not the slice. He’s a storyteller, not Michael Phelps. “I have a drowner’s body,” quips Birbiglia, who nevertheless reluctantly heads to a Brooklyn YMCA pool.', 'From the heart doc’s office he travels back to his youth, when his distaste for sports took root. First it was wrestling, which he hated. Then it was swimming at a Massachusetts YMCA pool, a place he associates with pee and chlorine and an unshakable odor.', '“It had that smell like when you’re little and a kid lets you smell under their cast.” Gross, and hilarious.

A series of prosceniums that successively shrink as they recede from the audience simply and efficiently suggest traveling backward.', 'That’s where the Irish author and actor heads in his adaptation of his 2021 memoir of the same title. Beyond some lighting cues and bits of music, the 2-hour production directed by Lonny Price (', 'Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar & Grill', ') is essentially a no-frills affair. Its greatest special effect: Byrne himself.', 'Now 72 with a resume that includes films (', 'The Usual Suspects', '), TV (', 'In Treatment', '), and Broadway (', 'A Touch of the Poet', '), Byrne is an able and appealing yarn-spinner. He summons a few various characters with a deft gesture or vocal shift. His tour of the past begins by recalling a dream that drew him home to Dublin.', 'Byrne sees his cash-strapped, flea-ridden youthful self as a “ghost boy.” As a kid, he bought a book jammed with 1,000 jokes and memorized them “so that people would like me for making them laugh.” Like the one about two cannibals eating a clown. “Does this taste funny?” one asks.', 'Flecked with wry humor, Byrne’s stage memoir leans more melancholy than merry. That’s par for the course. The specter of death looms fairly large. Dressed in a casual suit, Byrne takes a chronological path to introduce “ghosts” and their indelible marks on him. They include his working-class mother and father, a barrel maker, his doomed mentally ill sister, a friend who drowned, his grandmother who indulged his love for the cinema – and corn flakes.', 'It’s a deeply personal story, and there’s not much attempt to put his experiences in a larger context. Each self-contained, bite-sized section ends in a blackout. Connecting the dots between vignettes in a more powerful thematic way would give the show a cumulative wallop that now feels somewhat lacking.', 'Still, there are standout scenes. One of the best concerns a shopping splurge with his loving mother to buy clothes for his first communion. Money was tight, and his mother paid for the outfit with coins. As a child he was mortified. “I looked away,” Byrne remembers. “I was ashamed I was ashamed.”', 'At age 11, Byrne went to seminary school, where a predatory priest plied him with wine, put a hand on his knee, and vowed secrecy. “My child’s faith and trust in the world had been destroyed,” says Byrne.', 'Following that traumatic event, Byrne was adrift. He found work as a plumber, a dishwasher, and a hotel bathroom attendant. “You suspect this job might not be where you were born for,” Byrne observes.', 'Life changed when he found his way into an amateur acting company, where he at last felt welcome. Scruffy productions of Shakespeare plays became his drama school and eventually led to his life’s work.', 'Byrne doesn’t dwell on his starry career or his celebrity.

His revelation that he’s been sober for more than two decades drew applause from the audience.', 'Byrne concludes ', 'Walking with Ghosts', ' with another dream.

The very nature of attending this show is theatrical.', 'For the uninitiated, Lea Michele is a seasoned Broadway performer, who made her debut in ', 'Les Misérables', ' at age 8 and rose to fame in her early 20s in the cult hit ', 'Spring Awakening', ' before going on to more mainstream television roles, namely the ambitious and talented Rachel Berry on Ryan Murphy’s show choir dramedy ', 'Glee', ' from 2009-15.', 'On said series, Michele played a ruthless teenager dead set on making it on Broadway, namely in the titular role in ', 'Funny Girl', '. She sang the iconic Act 1 finale “Don’t Rain on My Parade” during the first season and later performed the number on the Tony Awards. In the show’s final season, the character made her Broadway debut in ', 'Funny Girl', ' and won the Tony for her performance.', 'While Michele won’t win a Tony Award for this outing – Tonys are only given to performers who originated the role, and Michele replaces ', 'Beanie Feldstein', ', who left the production over the summer – she is making quite the splash in her first time on Broadway in over a decade. It’s impossible to parse out every layer of meta-theatricality at play here, not least because the show itself is a show-within-a-show about a starry-eyed Ziegfeld comic hoping to become the “greatest star.”', 'But even without all the added contextual layers, Michele stands alone as a singular Broadway performer, one who can pack a house and command a crowd and also hit all the right notes and laughs. And even years on, she brings the same bright-eyed optimism and ingenuity that made audiences fall in love with her. When she sings “Don’t Rain on My Parade,” the audience feels as if they are somehow fulfilling a dream alongside her, and while premature claps and mid-song standing ovations can seem distracting, it’s all a part of this singular theatregoing experience. You, the audience, are also part of this spectacle.', 'Broadway and television favorite Tovah Feldshuh joined the company with Michele as Fanny’s overprotective mother, and she chews on all the scenery, stealing the show with numbers like “Henry Street” when Fanny returns home to a party the neighborhood where she grew up. Jared Grimes, who earned a Tony nomination for his jubilant and tap-tastic performance as Fanny’s friend Eddie Ryan, continues to give 110% in a thankless side role. With Grimes in the tap shoes, though, Eddie’s energy jumps right off the stage.', 'Ramin Karimloo stars as Nick Armstein, Fanny’s gambling addict of a manager-turned-husband, and while the role turns back the clock on feminism several years, Karimloo is charming and endearing even where his character falls short.', 'Directed by Michael Mayer, the production is cool and crisp, with stylish throwback choreography by Ellenore Scott (and gorgeous tap choreography by Ayodele Casel) and seamless sets by David Zinn and eye-popping costumes by Susan Hilferty.', 'While Harvey Fierstein’s revision of the book can’t do much to save the dated show (original book by Isobel Lennart), the audience isn’t coming to see the show for the plot. They’re coming for Jule Styne and Bob Merrill’s iconic songs, sung by the titular girl.

After all, the musical tells the story of a 16-year-old New Jersey girl with an age-accelerating disorder that’s forced her to face mortality before she’s had a chance to really live.', ""What makes this show — which won five Tonys, including Best Musical — so distinct and satisfying is the way its creators mined the plot's complexity for such riches and emotional payoffs. They nail the delicate balance between the extremes: what is, well, deadly serious and laugh-out-loud funny.

'A Christmas Carol' review — Jefferson Mays's inventive solo adaptation is a holiday blessing,"The splendid production of ', 'A Christmas Carol', ' starring Jefferson Mays in a solo tour de force gets off with a bang. Suffice it to say that a rousing theatrical effect does its job.', 'It grabs you by the lapels — actually, the eardrums — and commands your complete attention. This show and the actor playing some 50 roles deserve it.', 'Drawn from Charles Dickens’s 1843 classic about transformation, redemption, and the Christmas spirit (in every sense), the adaptation by Mays, Susan Lyons, and director and co-conceiver Michael Arden tells a familiar story. London miser Ebenezer Scrooge goes from signature greediness to goodwill thanks to visitations by ghosts on Christmas Eve. He’s all the better for it, and so are his employee Bob Cratchit and his family, especially frail Tiny Tim.', 'Odds are you know what’s coming in the next scene if not the next line – like Scrooge’s icy remark about his city’s neediest people and the pluses of decreasing the surplus population. Still, the show makes the time-worn classic feel as fresh and invigorating as a new fall of snow.', 'Reprising his star turn from a 2018 run of the show at the Geffen Theatre in Los Angeles, Mays is a one-man wonder. He plays everybody in the story, including a narrator who pops in and out, men, women, ghosts, kids, and stewed potatoes (yes, as in vegetables – while it sounds as nutty as a fruitcake, the moment works like a charm).', 'He has glinting eyes that can veer from endearing to creepy in an instant, a supple voice that jumps up an octave to play young Ebenezer Scrooge’s heartbroken lost love and back down to play his forgiving nephew, and nimble fingers that mischievously wag to summon rambunctious children.', 'My favorite moment: Mays embodies the ghost of Jacob Marley, Scrooge’s long-dead business partner, with just-from-the-grave, lock-jawed perfection. Other ghosts materialize via other forms of theatrical magic.', 'The 90-minute staging is packed with imagination and how-did-they-do-that surprises that get your mind buzzing with questions: Where did that staircase come from? How did Scrooge show up here when he was just over there? Do I hear murmuring in the theatre? Yes, thanks to sound designer Joshua D. Reid. Mentioning any more details would spoil the fun.', 'Conceived by Arden and Dane Laffrey, who designed the evocative set and costumes, this production is a celebration of storytelling. ', 'A Christmas Carol', ' revels in theatricality. It dives directly into this iconic tale’s pitch-black heart.', 'It’s no fluke that at times the only illumination is from a single flame. Like Scrooge, we’re meant to grope our way through the shadows before coming out on the other side. As a result, the final scene, lit by Ben Stanton, is all the more transcendent.', 'It’s easy to get a little humbug: Another holiday season, another take on ', 'A Christmas Carol', '.

So long, Verona and stifling parents keen on locking her up in a nunnery. Freedom awaits! Juliet (the terrific Lorna Courtney), now 22 in the revised tale, considers life on her own terms.', 'She makes a beeline for Paris with her nurse (Melanie La Barrie, reprising her role from the show’s London premiere), a new non-binary BFF May (Justin David Sullivan), and another pal, April – who is actually Anne. She and Shakespeare write themselves into the revision; he’s a carriage driver. Along the way, some 30 hits from the Max Martin catalog, including “...Baby One More Time,” “Roar,” and “Since U Been Gone,” knit the narrative together.', 'This setup happens with surprising speed and economy. The early zippy energy is a big plus. Vibrant visuals are another. Director Luke Sheppard’s staging makes great use of projections, flying set pieces, and a levitating circular platform to showcase dramatic moments and athletic dance moves by choreographer Jennifer Weber.', ""There's plenty of drama in France after Juliet and company meet Francois DuBois (Philippe Arroyo), who’s looking for love, and his stern father Lance (Tony winner Paulo Szot, game but frequently upstaged by his codpiece), who shares a secret history with Juliet’s nurse."", 'Thanks to Will’s desire to stir the plot, dim Romeo (Daniel Maldonado, in for Ben Jackson Walker at a recent performance) pops up. The newly undead guy descends in a superdope (to borrow his term) and glitzy entrance.', 'The action unfolds in Shakespeare’s era, but its heart and head are all about today. Costume designer Paloma Young pairs corsets, ruffs, and doublets with chunky boots and high-tops. There’s also a shoehorn lurking in the wings. As in any jukebox musical, some tunes are wedged in, but others fit surprisingly well.', '“I Want It That Way” becomes a useful all-purpose expression of desire, while “Oops! … I Did It Again” neatly covers romantic missteps. “Stronger” lets Juliet’s defiance toll. Romeo and Juliet’s conflicted feelings churn into a raucous “Problem/Can’t Feel My Face.”', 'Schitt’s Creek', ' writer David West Read penned the story, and it’s a mixed bag. ', '& Juliet', ""'s feminist attitude and celebration of gender fluidity make it topical. Mispronunciations of Francois’s surname makes way for (groan) DeBoy band jokes. And even with the youthful exuberance, the momentum sags whenever Anne and Will spar about the narrative — and they do it a lot."", 'The script looks to history (or Wikipedia?) to connect the dots between Anne, who Shakespeare disregarded, and suicidal Juliet. Creative license abounds, of course, but the script breezes over the fact that if Romeo is alive, then Juliet is still married. That puts a kink in major plot developments. In the end, the show has no fewer than three separate conclusions.', 'To see or not to see any or all of that as just nitpicking?

The conceit is that the run-through is being taped, and an opportunistic director decides to boost his cred by covertly digging around for gossip.', 'This narrative stroke is a solid idea. It adds another texture as the camera captures what’s going on backstage. (It recalls a technique from the playbook of Tony-winning director Ivo van Hove.) The roaming camera also works as a nod to ', 'KPOP', '’s immersive 2017 presentation that took audiences into various rooms in a music factory.', 'In the Broadway version, the phenom MwE (Luna, a South Korean K-pop star) has an emotional collapse that puts the concert in jeopardy for everybody. Flashbacks tie her breakdown to her mother’s long-ago abandonment and a toxic relationship with her Mama Rose-like mentor, Ruby (Jully Lee), a music titan who “built” her from a near-lost cause to a superstar. Exactly how MwE’s breakthrough came is murky.', 'After years of struggling and sacrificing everything — like boyfriends — for their shot, the girls of RTMIS panic. They’ll give MwE anything to help. “A pep talk. A drink. An organ. Anything,” one girl assures. The boys of F8, meanwhile, resent that Brad (Zachary Noah Piser), an Asian American guy, has replaced an original Korean-born band member for the American tour.', 'Beyond the echo-chamber narrative, there’s much to like. There’s an irresistible cast of performers — 18 of them are making Broadway debuts — and attention-getting work by the design team that delivers the goods and then some.', 'Songs by Helen Park and Max Vernon, who each wrote music and lyrics, are a catchy batch of K-pop pastiche ear ticklers. As with the dialogue, songs are performed in Korean and English for authenticity’s sake. Choreographer Jennifer Weber’s invaluable, crisp dance moves slice the air like razors.', 'Song themes don’t typically run too deep. That’s fitting for an artform in which Luna admits she’s become a “hit machine” warbling about happy things: “clouds and parties and marshmallows.” Some tracks dig a bit deeper, like “Perfect,” about unobtainable quests, “Wind Up Doll,” about being under one’s thumb, and “Halfway,” about searching for one’s place in the world.', 'In the end, of course, storylines get resolved and each group shines in the spotlight. The delightful final blowout number, “Blast Off,” brings everyone together and lives up to the song title. The closing tableau finds everyone wearing head-to-toe white. The inspiration?

'The Kite Runner' review — stage adaptation of bestselling book is faithful to a fault,"In ', 'The Kite Runner', "", kite flying factors in two pivotal scenes. In the first, the actors come out waving gauzy white fabric hanging from springy wire rods, giving the illusion of kites flying in the air. At my performance, one of the kites failed to sufficiently lift off above the actor's head. It hovered slightly, then dipped toward the ground. The actor valiantly tried to pull it up, but the kite refused to take flight, seemingly comfortable bobbing along at shoulder height. This can be a metaphor for the play, which tries to soar beyond its origins as a novel, but remains steadfastly bound by its source material.\xa0"", 'The Kite Runner', "" is based on Khaled Hosseini's bestselling 2003 novel of the same name. It is set in Afghanistan and is about two friends, Amir (Amir Arison) and Hassan (Eric Sirakian). The two are born only a year apart but have vastly different lives: Amir is rich and educated, Hassan is poor and illiterate; Amir is the master, Hassan is the servant; Amir is Pashtun, the dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan, while Hassan is Hazara, the minority group. Despite their differences, the two are best friends. But when Hassan is raped by a group of Pashtun boys, Amir chooses to runs away instead of helping his friend. That guilt, and his eventual redemption, makes up the bulk of the play and the novel.\xa0"", 'In adapting the story, Matthew Spangler turns ', 'The Kite Runner', ' into a memory play: Amir as an adult tells his story to us, the audience, as a flashback. Director Giles Croft (who has directed ', 'The Kite Runner', "" in London) has Arison play Amir as a boy and an adult, which means Arison never leaves the stage throughout the play's 2.5-hour running time. Fortunately, Arison is magnetic as Amir, his lanky frame and everyman energy making him an inherently sympathetic narrator (even when Amir does the unforgivable). Arison's voice is deep and rich; you hang onto his every word."", ""In a novel, you need such a narrator to help you visualize a story from start to finish. The theatre has additional tools: actors, sets, music. Not everything in a play needs to be verbally described to the audience. But instead of utilizing those stage elements, Spangler and Croft overly rely on Hosseini's words. The play doesn't give\xa0"", 'The Kite Runner', ' new dimensions, as an adaptation should. Instead, it feels like a CliffsNotes version of the novel.\xa0', ""The play tells the audience what is happening instead of showing it. In a pivotal kite flying scene, there are no kites onstage. Instead, Arison stands in a kite-flying stance, snapping his body back and forth while describing what is happening. In the background, the ensemble provides swooshing sound effects. By not letting the audience see the kite competition, the narration robs the scene of dramatic tension and an opportunity for dynamic visual storytelling. Instead of being shown the splendor of dozens of kites in the air, battling for dominance, we're told about it. It's a missed opportunity when the only real kite in the play is being sold in the gift shop."", ""Adaptations can also improve upon the source material. In the original novel, Hassan is less of a fully developed human than a sacrificial lamb that needs to be slaughtered for Amir's personal development. Sirakian, with his round face and bright eyes, is heartbreaking as the innocent Hassan. But he is not given much to do beyond being uncomplicatedly good. Any potential dimension has been cut away. In "", 'The Kite Runner', ' novel, after Hassan is raped, Amir describes not seeing him for a week, with Hassan\'s father, Ali, saying, ""Lately, it seems all he wants to do is sleep. He does his chores, but then he just wants to crawl under his blanket."" The play cuts that line during an exchange between Ali (Evan Zes) and Amir. So even when Hassan is in pain, that pain is not given space to breathe, and the audience is not invited to sit with that loss of innocence. Instead the stage is immediately filled with more words, more narration, more plot.\xa0', 'Compared with the surfeit of words, ', 'The Kite Runner', ' has a very sparse set: A cityscape backdrop, some hanging curtains for projections, and sloped walkways on either side of the stage that make it look like the play takes place in a skate park instead of Afghanistan.

The production also manages to find humor in Hosseini\'s prose. When Arison says, ""\u200b\u200bHassan\'s mother suffered a fate most Afghans consider far worse than death,"" he gives a well-placed pause before saying, ""She ran off with a troupe of actors and musicians.""', 'Toward the end of the play, Amir kneels down in prayer, his arms out and hands outstretched, repeating in Arabic: ""There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger.""

The main focus is people in need — and not just the two individuals who use wheelchairs, but the able-bodied attendants as well. All four face challenges and hurdles of every stripe. That’s the point — that’s the cost of living.', 'The action unspools over nine scenes, and Wilson Chin’s spare, revolving set provides a smooth and seamless showcase in this Manhattan Theatre Club production. The play starts in a bar a week before Christmas. “That’s gonna be hard,” Eddie (David Zayas), an out-of-work long-haul truck driver, tells an unseen character in a lengthy — a bit too windy, actually — monologue. Holiday cheer isn’t in Eddie’s wheelhouse. He’s alone, suffering, untethered.\xa0', 'The plot rewinds to September and the sleek New Jersey apartment where John (Gregg Mozgala), a Princeton grad student, lives. He’s got a Harvard degree and wealth. He wraps himself up in the comfort they afford just like he does in his plush cashmere sweaters. John has cerebral palsy and requires help for daily hygiene tasks.\xa0', 'Jess (Kara Young), meets with John to apply to be his caretaker. She’s working-class with a sick immigrant mother and a Princeton degree that’s led nowhere careerwise for her. She slings drinks in bars. John says her job would be “to wash me. My hair. Teeth… You’d keep me handsome.” She gets the gig. She’s desperate for money for reasons that emerge.', 'The story transitions to the rundown home of Ani (Katy Sullivan), Eddie’s estranged wife. A catastrophic accident shattered her spinal cord and left her a quadriplegic above-the-knee amputee. She’s bitter, and rightly so, with a salty tongue and no time for self-pity. Despite having a girlfriend, Eddie insists on caring for Ani. He’s motivated by financial and emotional reasons.\xa0', 'As the months move forward, each pair grows closer. In back-to-back scenes, Jess washes John as he strips, and she helps him into his shower. It’s an intimate arrangement, but it plays out with a sense of equal mutual respect — or so it seems. At Ani’s place, Eddie bathes his ex. He talks about playing the piano as a kid. “Twenty-almost-one years,” she says. “You never told me that.” In a moment of acute tenderness that reveals Majok’s sensitive and creative mind, Eddie plays Ani’s arm like a keyboard. Moments later, things take a harrowing turn that jolts them — and the audience — back to reality.', 'It’s easy to root for these couples — not necessarily in a romantic sense but simply in terms of human connection. Guided by director Jo Bonney, the actors don’t strike a false note — even when the script gets spotty. Although the fate of Eddie and Ani’s relationship is all too believable, that’s less the case for John and Jess. While John’s lack of generosity is obvious, Jess getting sucker-punched by misreading her boss undercuts her character’s keen intelligence.\xa0', 'How the couples’ story strands finally twine together requires a leap of faith.

There's a healthy helping of intellectual talk — Stoppard's specialty — but it's not esoteric, and in the hands of a superb Brandon Uranowitz, who gets to philosophize the most as the mathematician Ludwig, it's endlessly captivating.

The ghost of Sutter, a white man whose ancestors enslaved the Charleses, haunts the house. Berniece asks Avery to bless the residence to get rid of the spirit, but finally comes to realize that tapping into with her family’s past, not shunning it, is what it takes for an exorcism.', 'The cast is uniformly wonderful.

In the case of Paula Vogel's Pulitzer Prize-winning play\xa0"", 'How I Learned to Drive', ', which just premiered on Broadway at the ', 'Samuel J.

And what words they are. Vogel has arranged the story of Li'l Bit ("", 'Mary-Louise Parker', ') as a set of non-chronological flashbacks that show the audience how she became a shiftless vagabond who only feels alive when she is driving full pedal to medal.\xa0', ""Each blip in her life is named for a chapter in an instructional guide for driving a car, with brief interludes devoted to other lessons such as drinking like a lady, all announced by the play's Greek chorus. They also play Li'l Bit's family members, who take their names from their genitalia. Her sobriquet references how tiny her vagina was when she was born, while her lecherous grandfather Big Papa (Chris Meyers, as the male Greek chorus) is named not for his height but for the size of his penis.\xa0"", ""Li'l Bit is raised by her single mother (Johanna Day, as the female Greek chorus), grandmother (Alyssa May Gold, as the teenage Greek chorus), and Uncle Peck ("", 'David Morse', ""). Peck lavishes her with all the attention and encouragement that her family refuses to pay her. Rather than lift up her brilliant mind, the rest bitterly squash her in antiquated ideas about a woman's place: on her back or in the kitchen."", ""Though Peck's attention lifts her up, the price she bears for his favor is inappropriate touches and grinds, as well as requests for sexually charged photo sessions. Like many groomers, Peck frames his requests around choice; he will not do anything unless Li'l Bit wants him to, though he constantly coaxes, isolates, and positions her until there is no other alternative. Though her family is aware of what is going on, they stay silent and blame Li'l Bit for making it happen. As her aunt (also played by Day) insists, she is not as innocent as she looks and certainly knows what she is doing."", ""What helps to protect the audience from feeling overwhelmed by these malicious characters is watching Parker assay the role in all of her incarnations, from gawky teenager to unmoored adult. Vogel has wisely placed the adult version of Li'l Bit in the body of her younger self; watching a child navigate these traps would be too cruel. That is, until the very end, when Gold embodies Li'l Bit as she suffers her first assault.\xa0"", ""Dressed in Dede Ayite's yellow sundress ― which perfectly encapsulates the first budding on a flower ― Gold looks as if she were no more than 11 years old. Her tears soil her dress as she quietly asks Peck to stop. Her plea grows into a howl that reverberates throughout the entire play.

Unfortunately, the dinosaur comes in at the beginning of this three-hour production, and the play struggles in the wake of its long tail.\xa0', 'At first glance, a revival of ', 'The Skin of Our Teeth', "" makes sense.

And through it all, the family stays together and survives — it's the end of the world as we know it, and the Antrobuses feel fine.\xa0Wilder wrote this three-act play in the years leading up to World War II (it premiered on Broadway in 1942 starring Tallulah Bankhead as the Antrobuses' hysterical, hilarious maid Sabina)."", 'Considering the multiple global crises we are collectively going through (climate change, a pandemic, threat of World War III), 2022 feels like the ideal time to revive ', 'The Skin of Our Teeth', "".

It's filled with Brechtian fourth-wall breaks, characters from the Bible, and philosophical musings on the nature of existence.

She is able to find the sensitive, maternal woman in the broadly drawn housewife archetype, and her comic timing and side-eye are razor-sharp.\xa0', 'The glory role in ', 'The Skin of Our Teeth', ' belongs to Gabby Beans as Sabina. Her eyes are wide in a state of perpetual surprise, and Beans starts off speaking in a voice I can only describe as campy Eartha Kitt.

But the amplification has the unfortunate effect of obscuring what she is actually saying. When the Antrobuses scramble onto a boat as the flood is coming, Lopez shouts, ""Start a new world. Begin again."" But her words are swallowed up by the chaos around her, and the effect is lost. Even as the alarms sound, the racially diverse ensemble is still dancing, making the message even more muddled. Is the audience supposed to be afraid for them? Or comforted that at least they\'re meeting their end in style? It\'s chaos with no coherence.', ""For a play about the end of the world, there's also a surprising lack of tension here.

'for colored girls' review — individual colors don't make a cohesive rainbow,"Ntozake Shange's powerful paean to Black women, "", 'for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf', ', returns to Broadway in a bold revival that burns intensely, though with little nuance. As directed and choreographed by the much-lauded dancemaker Camille A. Brown, this production places an exclamation point at the end of its title, as if to claim that it will punch through every moment of grief until all that is left is celebratory victory.\xa0', ""While that approach serves as a pleasant corrective to Lea C. Gardner's gloom-laden interpretation of the work ― which played at "", 'The Public Theater', ' in 2019, with Brown as choreographer ― it does not create much of a throughline between the numerous arias assigned to ', 'for colored girls', ""'s characters. Nor does it deepen the meaning of the text. Instead, audiences are presented beautiful pictures and intense moments that smolder in isolation."", 'In composing ', 'for colored girls', ', Shange borrowed from African griot traditions to craft a new form of epic storytelling: the choreopoem, a fusion of poetry, dance, music, and song that transcends plot. The choreopoem instead focuses on establishing emotional rapport with audiences through the lyricism of Black language and customs as Shange experienced them. In ', 'for colored girls', ', Black women are represented by different colors, such as Lady in Blue (Stacey Sargeant, delightful) or Lady in Brown (Tendayi Kuumba, a lioness), and given rhapsodic poems that plumb every hue.', 'Rather than rely on words alone, Shange mandated that the unconquerable spirit of Black womanhood take flight through movement and music in addition to text. Brown, who has created her own resounding choreopoems ― most notably ', 'BLACK GIRL: Linguistic Play', ' and ', 'Mr. TOL E. RAncE', ' ― has not yet woven those elements into a cohesive whole. Rather, she delineates as if she were directing a traditional Broadway musical, or even a revue.', 'When the women dance, it often feels as if they are staking their claim to the entire universe. While that image is satisfying, it does not engage with what the text tells us: besides strong, Black women are also soft, vulnerable, confusing, inquisitive, and impossible to nail down. In presenting her cast as consummate warriors, Brown limits the range of what they can convey.\xa0', 'This is most clear with Lady in Yellow (D. Woods), who dives wholeheartedly into the exuberance of a young Black woman exploring her sexual agency. Yellow is often seen as the color of friendship, but it also deepens into royal gold. True to initial form, Woods strikes all the highlights of fun inquisitiveness and excitement that we associate with a young women enraptured by her own sexual power, but she stops short of commanding newer territory. Instead, she presents a collection of poses that lose meaning with every repetition.\xa0', ""Similarly, and through no fault of her own, Lady in Purple's (Alexandria Wailes) voice is also left unfulfilled. Indeed, her right to tell her own story is stolen by the decision to have Lady in Orange (Amara Granderson) speak for her. Wailes, who is deaf, signs beautifully, and with greater distinction than Granderson is able to convey. But even if Granderson had a better handle of her text, Brown is more than capable of transliterating Shange's aria for Wailes into brilliant movement language. Depriving Wailes of the opportunity to speak solely for herself is disappointing.\xa0"", 'However, ', 'for colored girls', ' frequently soars, particularly when its performers meet the moments that Brown is trying to convey. Lady in Green, Okwui Okpokwasili (in a brilliant Broadway debut) shows us what might have been as she calmly swaggers through the fantastic ""Somebody Almost Run Off With Alla My Stuff."" Here she shows us that green is not only the color of envy, but also earthy dominion as she takes the full measure of someone who tries to own her without really understanding the immensity of her being: ""If it\'s really my stuff you got, you got to give it to me.

A rope used for centuries to dehumanize and murder Black bodies and executing (many innocent) convicts doesn't sit well when repurposed as humor.

Despite that dour premise, over the course of this life-affirming play, they rehash old beefs and put to rest long-simmering prejudices.', ""Confronting differences in response to death is nothing new in theatre. Refreshingly, in this laughter-rich script, and under Zhailon Levington's sparkling direction, the experience eschews the pitfalls of typical media portrayals of Black tragedy in favor of Black joy. For many traditional Broadway audience members, this play will be the first time that they observe the wit and merriment that Black-American families have long used to counteract grief."", 'Though there is much that is serious onstage in this two-hour-long comedy, Lyons has wisely embraced the authentic Black tradition of call-and-response humor to detangle the pain. And rather than take the longheld maxim that comedy must be ""louder-faster-funnier,"" Levingston ― who at the age of 27 is the youngest Black director in Broadway history ― unfurls the story at a relaxed and multi-rhythmic pace.', ""At the top of the show, we are introduced to a frazzled Black mother Baneatta (Cleo King) preparing for her father's funeral as her pastor-husband Reginald ("", 'Norm Lewis', "") attempts to calm her nerves. The action jumps to a ne'er do well, single mother Beverly (Ebony Marshall-Oliver) seeking assurance from her teenage daughter La'Trice (Aigner Mizzelle) that her church outfit is sexy.

The oldest granddaughter of the family (Alana Raquel Bowers) rounds out the action with the same withering gaze as her judgmental mother.', ""What brings this family together also traumatizes them: oppressive church values that stifle who they are. We see this, most hilariously, as Baneatta exhorts Beverly to cover her titties up with the same relish that she deploys to dismiss the existence of the Kenny-Logan relationship. As in real life, that disapproval against anything out-of-the-box evaporates as soon as the Baptist sermon begins. In Lewis's performance, ripped from many a Black-scripture-readings, we see that even the most-reserved prudes let their hair down to dance when it's time to celebrate their god."", 'As the proxy for unfamiliar audience members, Urie works every delectable angle of his Jewish ""what-am-I-doing-here?"" cipher as Logan to gut-busting effect. Rather than look down on Black life with these moments, Lyons and Levingston use them to lovingly comment on the over-the-top theatricality of the Black church. Lewis, as Reginald, and his amazing colleagues playfully dance back and forth between Biblical points before shimmying into the audience with gospel riffs, but without fear of reproval. So why can\'t they acknowledge the love of their gay son with that same openness? Or embrace that their departed loved one was a philanderer?', ""Kenny reveals he didn't fall in love with a white man because he rejects Black men, but because Logan was the first man to lovingly insist that he push through the closet to celebrate who he is, without shame. Similarly, Marshall-Oliver as Beverly pierces Baneatta's stiff veneer as her congregation's first lady by showing her how to release her pains with a series of breaths and repeated hallelujahs."", ""Initially, Baneatta is hesitant, but after observing her sister's cycle through the gestures ― in what Levingston has knowingly constructed to approximate the release of an African dance's contract and release ― she joins and breaks through the wall that has held her back for so long."", ""All is not perfect by the play's end, but as the family digs into their meal of chicken and biscuits, audiences are reminded that trauma does not have to define how we move through the world ― rather, we see that it is an invitation to work through our differences between the people we love most.

'Thoughts of a Colored Man' review - timely new play shows the universe in Black men,"Shakespeare once wrote, ""What a piece of work is a man!"" In that famous monologue from Hamlet, Shakespeare was writing about, in part, the varied beauty and contradictions within humanity. Granted, Shakespeare was talking about white men, who for centuries have been given the gift of being seen as fully formed human beings. Unfortunately, while this benefit was extended to white men, it has not been extended to Black men. That sense of humanity, virtues, and flaws in Black men is what Keenan Scott II\'s powerful new Broadway play, ', 'Thoughts of a Colored Man', ' aims to portray.', 'Thoughts of a Colored Man', "" follows seven different Black men as they go through their day in Brooklyn. These men may live in the same neighborhood but they each have individually compelling stories. There's Depression who had to defer his dreams in order to take care of his struggling family; there's Passion who was raised without a father and in need of guidance as he's about to become one; there's Happiness who is gay and well-to-do and trying to find community.\xa0"", 'The other men are similarly named with different emotions (Wisdom, Love, Anger, Passion). What Scott and the cast skillfully portray is how each man is fully formed and contains multitudes: both tough and vulnerable, fearful of love yet deeply craving it.\xa0', 'Scott wrote ', 'Thoughts of a Colored Ma', 'n as a response to the stereotypical ways that Black men are portrayed in the wider culture. So, in the play, every man has the space to convey his own thoughts to the audience, while also interacting with his fellow man. The set (by Robert Brill) is simple: a billboard with the word ""colored"" on it in all caps. Every time a scene changes, the billboard changes to a different projection (Sven Ortel), and the sound design (Mikaal Sulaiman) and lighting (Ryan O\'Gara) give the audience a new sense of place. The design gives the play a mosaic quality: These individual monologues and dialogues add up to a whole portrait, one of the universal humanity within Black men.', ""A scene in the barbershop with all seven men conveys Scott's ability to write for different types of voices: the dialogue crackles and swerves, personalities and conflicts, and probing questions about gentrification and poverty are brought up. The production is also buoyed by the chemistry of the cast, and the different energies they each bring to their characters. One thing is made perfectly clear: the Black community, and Black men especially, are not a monolith.\xa0"", 'Thoughts of a Colored Man', "" borrows aspects of Ntozake Shange's For colored girls...., which was an expansive portrait of Black women. Both plays have similar allegorical naming conventions for its character and they are also performed in verse. "", 'Thoughts of a Colored Man', ' uses slam poetry, spoken word, and song. That gives Thoughts of a Colored Man a lyrical beauty, with lines like, ""If I knew that some of the kids I played, ran and jumped with would experience death before adulthood, I would\'ve made sure I cherished those moments a little bit more,"" gorgeous in their construction and devastating in their specificity.\xa0', ""Within the play, Scott also touches on many hot-button culturally specific topics, including homophobia, class divides, fatherhood, and what being a man truly means. It's an overflowing basket of topics for one play; any of these threads could be a play by themselves, and hopefully they will be. As "", 'Thoughts of a Colored Man', ' shows, Scott is able to skillfully write multiple differing viewpoints and his luscious prose should continue to be shared with audiences.\xa0', 'Yet in trying to create a look at Black men that goes beyond the stereotypical, Scott does fall into some of the same thematic conventions that are common in Black narratives.\xa0', 'For instance, when', ' Thoughts of a Colored Man', "" veers towards the tragic, it's understandable why that element is in the play — it represents a certain reality. Yet I wondered if that plot point also played into what audiences expect when they come to a show about Black men. It definitely played into mine, which is in itself indicative of what the wider culture has trained us to expect from Black narratives: sadness, death. In meeting the audience's expectations, Scott deviates from what he set out to do, which is to tell a narrative about Black men that is rarely told."", 'And in giving his character names rooted in emotions, Scott also makes them archetypes instead of humans. ""All we wanted was to be ourselves, to live,"" says Depression (played by Forrest McClendon, a standout performance). What does a play about Black life look like when the characters aren\'t being a representation and are instead, just living?\xa0', 'Thoughts of a Colored Man', "" won't provide that answer. At the same time, it is an important work for the current moment. Because as long as Black men are unjustly murdered by police officers and incarcerated with abandon, "", 'Thoughts of a Colored Man', ' and what it aims to do will continue to be relevant and necessary.\xa0', 'Thoughts of a Colored Man is at the Golden Theatre.

'Trouble in Mind' review — the kind of good trouble Broadway needs,"I once asked a famed Tony-winning Broadway director, what is the point of a revival?

If the same question was asked about the glorious revival, and belated Broadway debut, of Alice Childress's play "", 'Trouble in Mind', ',\xa0the answer would definitely be a resounding yes. Though the play was written in 1955, it pulsates with such vitality that it feels like it was written yesterday, showing the audience that while some things have changed in 66 years, others have stayed maddeningly the same.\xa0', ""In 1955, Childress's play "", 'Trouble in Mind', '\xa0premiered off Broadway and was well-received critically.

Randolph-Wright threads that needle finely;\xa0the audience are charmed by the actors and their interpersonal dynamics. Then when rehearsals start for the play-within-a-play, it is clear where the characters have had to compromise themselves, so moments when the Black actors have to play stereotypes, the discomfort is pronounced.\xa0', 'Trouble in Mind', '\xa0runs at 2\xa0hours and 10 minutes, but once it gets going, Randolph-Wright keeps it moving briskly like a runaway train. And when the inevitable crash comes, it is breathtaking.\xa0', ""At the center of the play is LaChanze's Wiletta, who is tired of playing the maid and wants to be a legitimate actress. Dressed in Emilio Sosa's sumptuous period costumes, LaChanze's natural magnetism means that it is even more offensive when Wiletta is forced to be sidelined in the narrative. Wiletta's frustrations are a slow build but when she inevitably breaks into an earth-shattering monologue in the second act, it's not only earned, but necessary."", 'The rest of the characters are not as fully developed as Wiletta, which is a shame. But the cast is so dynamic that even when they are in the background, you want to look at them and take in the entire tableau — particularly Chuck Cooper and Jessica Frances Dukes, who are skilled at conveying depth, even contempt, in just looks and small actions.', 'Childress wrote ', 'Trouble in Mind', '\xa0because of her frustrations at the lack of substantive roles for Black actors.

', 'Sharon D\xa0Clarke', ' delivers one such stunning star turn in this revival of ', 'Caroline, or Change', ', propelled onto Broadway by her acclaim in its previous London run.

Review of What the Constitution Means to Me on Broadway,"Midway through ', 'What the Constitution Means to Me', ', the captivating history lesson cum family memoir that has moved to the\xa0', 'Hayes Theater', "" after a triumphant off-Broadway run, the show's writer and star, "", 'Heidi Schreck', ', makes one of her many seemingly unscripted comments. Holding her hands to her cheeks, she confides that her face ""hurts from smiling."" It is at that point that Schreck drops any last pretence of being a character in a play, rather than the intimate confidant that the audience by then knows her to be. And if her achy jaws are a sign of just how clearly Schreck loves to perform this work, it is also a metaphor. Politeness with a forced smile, she implies, has been a very unsatisfactory substitute for rage against oppression, for her as well as for the women who came before her. If this show, told mostly in monologue, is an overt tutorial on one of America\'s founding documents, it is equally a master class in contemporary feminism.', 'The personal was political for Schreck from the age of 15 when, as she demonstrates, she raised money for college by participating in debates about the Constitution that were staged in American Legion halls around the country. She and her ""fiercest competitor,"" a girl named Becky Lee, would stand in front of groups of old white men, expounding on the genius of a document created by a group of old, white men, while being held to a strict time limit by a white man with a stopwatch (Here, played disarmingly by the fine ', 'Mike Iveson', '). Her adult life, in a world of conservative Supreme Court justices and a certain unnamed, but never far from mind, dictatorial American president, proves no less burdensome.', 'Artifice has no place in this production.

She climbs through her maternal family tree revealing multiple generations of women who persisted through physical attacks and chemical depression to arrive at a point where she and her relatives are ""mostly okay."" Schreck herself is quirky enough to still be emotionally attached to a stuffed animal yet self-aware enough to realize how problematic that can be for a middle-aged woman. Her writing is filled with smart, comic pivots and, as sharply directed by ', 'Oliver Butler', ', she underplays the cruel absurdity of old dudes in robes making decisions about her body to full, devastating effect.', ""The play's last scene shifts away from her story and embraces "", 'herstory', '. Schreck is joined on stage by an African-American high school girl (either ', 'Rosdely Ciprian', ' or ', 'Thursday Williams', ', depending on the night), and the two hold a formal Parliamentary debate over whether or not the Constitution should be abolished.

Reasons to see ‘Hadestown’ on Broadway,"The road to hell has never been so heavenly at Anaïs Mitchell's Tony Award-winning Best Musical, which puts a modern, jazzy spin on classic Greek mythology."", '""Don’t look back"" can be excellent advice. It certainly applies to the plot of the dazzling ', 'Hadestown', ', the 2019 Best Musical Tony winner ', 'drawn from Greek mythology', '. In the show, a backward glance by Orpheus at his love Eurydice during their journey out of the underworld spells disaster. After all, he’d been commanded to keep his eyes off the prize – namely, her.', 'But here’s the thing: Rearview glances can also be a good thing, and ', 'Hadestown', ' is all the proof you need. By looking back at ancient stories and finding new ways to tell them, the show’s creators give theatre audiences a thrilling musical experience.', 'Get ', 'Hadestown', ' tickets', ' now.', 'Even before Shakespeare noted that “the course of true love never did run smooth,” the Greeks had already been there, observed that in myths that merged the lives of gods and mortals. Anaïs Mitchell, who wrote the show’s book, lyrics, and music, hasn’t gotten rid of the almighty gods. But the focus feels fixed on a human level – and all the desires and fallibility that goes with it – and the story resonates all the more eloquently.', ""The gist is that Orpheus must travel to the underworld, here a soulless sweatshop where Eurydice's trapped, to rescue and finally be with her. Both Eurydice, who’s desperate to survive, and Orpheus, whose mind is muddy with uncertainty, make bad decisions borne of out of their fraught situations along the way. Relatable? You bet.

It’s a blissful blend of music, staging, and performance that builds to summon next-level emotions.', 'The scene is accompanied by overhead lamps that sway hypnotically in director Rachel Chavkin’s production. Each time I’ve seen the scene on stage, I imagine the concept of ""the lightbulb moment"" must’ve inspired it. You have to see it live to fully appreciate it.', 'Depending on how you view it, choosing your favorite performer is either a snap or impossible. That’s because it’s whoever’s in the spotlight at any given moment. The whole cast has great material to milk as they breathe life into their characters.', 'Beyond the lovers, there’s Hades, who rules the underworld with an iron fist, and his wife Persephone, who’s willing to go to bat for young lovers as she considers what’s become of her own marriage. Hermes is a garrulous guide who regularly breaks the fourth wall to keep the audience up to speed.

It\'s anthem song is not ""One Day More,"" but ""Until Tomorrow."" And, ""At The End of the Day,"" as the peasants sing in ""Les Mis,"" the French and English in the new musical ""A Tale of Two Cities,"" all opine about ""The Way It Ought To Be.""', 'Staged on metal pillars that move frequently and look more like ""Rent"" than 18th century Paris or London, ""Tale"" does capture the essence of Charles Dickens\' novel and no one will have trouble following the classic tale. But Jill Santoriello -- who wrote the book, music and lyrics -- wisely refocused the story of the bourgeoisie vs. the aristocracy on the complex character of Sidney Carton.', 'Carton was a reprobate, a drunk who whiled away his time in taverns, and kept company with grave robbers and other assorted lowlifes. But Dickens believed that even the basest of characters had the potential for nobility, and Carton, played by the exhilarating James Barbour, rises to that height as he takes leave of his head.', 'Barbour is one of the few members of the cast that is not a ""Les Mis"" alumnus, and his portrayal of the solitary Carton provides the originality of character that this ""Les Mis"" wannabe is often lacking. In this same vein, Brandi Burkhardt, making her Broadway debut, lends credence and vocal skills to a downplayed Lucie Manette, heroine of the tale. When the show focuses on their story, we are theirs, but when it lapses into ""Les Mis,"" we forget it\'s ""A Tale of Two Cities.""', 'Madame DeFarge, that indefatigable knitter, however, brings us back. Played by understudy Anne Tolpegin (for Natalie Toro), DeFarge brings the French Revolution to a personal level. Her performance of ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind"" is a fire-breathing show-stopper, and adds to the story\'s passion.', 'Gregg Edelman renders Dr. Manette with stoic tenderness, and his voice has gotten richer since he first appeared in ""Cats"". His duets with Burkhardt, and Aaron Lazar who plays Charles Darnay, are formidable, but we half-expect him to sing ""Bring Him Home"" in the second act.', 'What the show is missing more than anything is the comic relief between the members of the lower classes. These scoundrels, led by Craig Bennett and Nick Wyman, playing Jerry Cruncher and Barsad, tell us there\'s ""No Honest Way"" and no honor among thieves, but neither the lyrics nor their lines give us anything akin to Thenardier and ""Master of the House.""', '""A Tale of Two Cities"" is, to use one of its signature songs, a ""Dream Come True"" for Santoriello, who has been envisioning a Broadway run of her musical for 20 years. Together with executive producers Barbra Russell and Ron Sharpe, who met while performing in ""Les Mis"", they culled what worked and used performers whom they knew would produce the sound and ambiance they wanted. But in so doing, they created something too much like what went before.', 'Despite this weakness, ""Tale"" will touch you deeply especially when Carton goes to keep his appointment with the guillotine, for when the story focuses on him, ""A Tale of Two Cities"" soars. Barbour brings a dignity to this ne\'er-do-well that is undeniable and we forgive him all his sins even before he is beheaded.

Itï¿½s fun and provided the title of a terrific revue containing many of Sondheimï¿½s hits that played Broadway in the late 1970s and really deserves to be updated and revived.', 'Despite the gimmick, there is not much that is special about this production.', '\xa0', '\xa0', 'Review by ', 'Barbara Mehlman', ""Prominently displayed in the great Pantheon of Musical Theater are the names of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Kander and Ebb, and Lerner and Loewe. Their popular musicals -- some written 50 years ago -- ran for hundreds of performances, yet their songs are sung today by cabaret artists, probably on an average of one every five minutes. Irving Berlin's 'Annie Get Your Gun' alone contributed seven songs to the standard repertoire."", ""Then there's Stephen Sondheim. Of the 14 musicals he wrote, only one -- 'Send In The Clowns' -- can be considered a standard. Yet he's the most original, admired, copied, respected, and by many, loved musical theater writer today."", 'Admittedly his works are frequently difficult, both musically and conceptually, but always they are worth the intellectual and emotional workout. I like to think of them as the equivalent of singing op-ed pieces, written to poke at our comfort and flay our most deeply held myths. That he can perform this feat with wit and wisdom is what makes him so great.', ""'Into the Woods,' Sondheim's 1987 musical which ran nearly two years, is the most obvious of his myth-busters, dealing with the aftermath of Happily Ever After. Is life really blissful for Cinderella after marrying Prince Charming? What happens to Jack after he slays a Giant and becomes rich?"", ""This season, the Happily Ever After myth has shown up again on Broadway in an unusual and oddly cast, revival of 'Company,' Sondheim's look at marriage as seen from the perspective of the commitment-challenged Bobby who's just turned 35 and insists he's ready to be married. Except that if he is, then why isn't he?"", 'All five New York couples come to celebrate Bobby\'s birthday, and the more they sing about married life, the more one has to wonder about its wonders. Harry and Sarah are a couple addicted to one another, as well as to alcohol and food. Susan and Peter have divorced but still live together, ""more married now than when we were married.""', 'Amy, who\'s about to marry Paul, sings the tongue-twisting, jaw-breaking, breath-taking \'Getting Married Today,\' insisting that she\'s not getting married.

This Joanne, played by Barbara Walsh, is missing that je ne sais quoi that made Stritch's performance a show-stopper, and this one so ordinary."", 'The same is true for Heather Laws, who plays Amy. The script calls for someone ""skinny"" but Laws is buxom and zaftig. The problem here lies with director John Doyle, who conceived the recent revival of \'Sweeney Todd\' in which the cast played the instruments. He duplicates that gimmick here to lesser effect and as a result, the casting is compromised.', ""Even Raul Esparza, who plays Bobby but not an instrument, is miscast. In 'tick, tick BOOM' and 'The Rocky Horror Show' he was electric, but here he's barely charged -- until he sings 'Being Alive.' Sad that we have to wait till the end of the show to see him do his stuff."", ""'Company,' however, is still very much worth seeing, despite my griping. Sondheim's lyrics are brilliant, you can really hum the music, and as always, he's ever provocative and always relevant. The show is simply performed in concert style on a non-set of platforms, with a black grand piano adorned only by a vase of funereal white lilies.

This year, the newness of the concept seems to be over."" & ""The fact is that if you haven\'t seen this show before in a fully staged production, you won\'t know what\'s going on in the show. As for Esparza, he sings his 11 o\'clock number, ""Being Alive,"" in a tone of misplaced rage, not bittersweet hope. That\'s a loss for the thematic richness of this show. The question that really looms over this production is why Sondheim would have allowed it to be brought to Broadway in the first place.""', 'LINDA WINER of NEWSDAY: ""How much does it mean to say that ""Company,"" which opened last night with a breakthrough performance by Raï¿½l Esparza, is the very best revival that Broadway has ever seen of Stephen Sondheim\'s landmark 1970 musical? Of course, except for a well-intentioned but earnest production in 1995, this also happens to be the only return of this beloved but ever-troubled masterwork to the town it embraces with dazzling ambivalence. But British director John Doyle, who radically reinvented Sondheim\'s ""Sweeney Todd"" last season, has triumphed again - more gently this time, and with less at stake. As in ""Sweeney,"" the actors also play instruments onstage. With ""Sweeney,"" however, Doyle was tampering with a massive repertory staple that had already worked magnificently in operatic and chamber versions. In contrast, nobody really expects \'Company\' to work."" & ""The novelty remains Doyle\'s technique of using actors as their own orchestra. The news is that he utilizes the style to save the show - turning it from an episodic concert to a cohesive and satisfying emotional experience. His version combines material from the original and the 1995 revivals here and at London\'s Donmar Warehouse. Somehow, he has made more than a few scenes feel so fresh, even daring, that we had to check the script to make sure we\'d heard most of them before.""', 'PETER MARKS of THE WASHINGTON POST: ""In his Broadway revival of ""Sweeney Todd,"" he gave the lovably bloodthirsty Mrs. Lovett a tuba. Now, in ""Company,"" John Doyle places bachelor-hero Bobby behind a piano. And once again, the new notes this innovative director teases out of a Stephen Sondheim musical combine to produce a novel symphony of buoyant surprises."" & ""There was the worry that the production, coming so soon after ""Sweeney,"" would seem like mere opportunism, an attempt to artificially extend the life of an esoteric concept. Turns out the anxiety was misplaced. If skepticism is in the air as you walk into the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where ""Company"" opened last night, elation is the feeling walking out. Invigorated by the brooding charisma of Raul Esparza, in the most controlled and captivating performance of his career, Doyle\'s ""Company"" proves a marvelous showcase for Sondheim\'s artistry. Many of the songs in this savvy, inventive musical -- whose importance seems only to grow with time -- are handled as wittily and tenderly as you are likely to hear them.""', 'MICHAEL KUCHWARA of ASSOCIATED PRESS: ""At one point, Esparza poses like a modern-day martyr, standing weirdly as if he were St. Sebastian against a looming white column that divides the Barrymore stage. Unlike Sebastian, though, he isn\'t pierced by arrows but by the stinging barbs of his critical friends. Those friends are played by actors, who, like Esparza, appeared in this revival when it was done earlier in the year at Cincinnati\'s Playhouse in the Park. They are a likable group, but they rarely raise the show\'s theatrical temperature. It might be those musical instruments. Marching around a stage while carrying a French horn or a triangle would make anyone feel self-conscious. You can see these performers working their way through the roles ï¿½ and carefully concentrating on playing those instruments when they should be creating characters."" & ""\'Company\' is a musical about relationships ï¿½ or the lack of relationships. They may be messy and misunderstood, but they are better than the lonely alternative that is facing Bobby on his 35th birthday. The show may not always be joyous, but it shouldn\'t be funereal, which is what occasionally comes across in this production. Maybe it is the monochromatic costumes. Or the spare, almost nonexistent setting, which has the actors quietly sitting on stage ï¿½ sort of like in the cemetery scene from ""Our Town"" ï¿½ when they aren\'t performing. There\'s even a vase of lilies on the baby grand.""', 'DAVID ROONEY of VARIETY: ""After yielding the most singularly exciting musical theater experience on Broadway last season with ""Sweeney Todd,"" the collaboration of director John Doyle and composer Stephen Sondheim has spawned another arresting revival with \'Company.\' "" & ""As Robert, the central figure marking his 35th birthday by pondering why he\'s the only one of his circle not married, Raul Esparza strikes just the right balance of easy charm and circumspect distance, alone even in a crowd of friends. He\'s a deeply ambiguous mass of swirling contradictions -- confused but self-knowing, seductive but standoffish, vulnerable but heavily armored, open to love but ambivalent. And Bobby\'s sexual identity is called more directly into question here than perhaps ever before. Esparza has been hovering on the brink of Broadway stardom for some years, and this is a terrific role for him with his sad-eyed, brooding good looks, wry humor and passionate singing voice. In the past, he has often cranked up the vibrato a little strenuously, but he\'s in fine, controlled voice here -- robust at times, soft and sweet at others.

Sunday in the Park with George,"Review by ', 'Michael Hillyer', ' February 24, 2017', ""Sarna Lapine's stunning new production of James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim's Sunday In The Park With George, which has welcomed back the newly renovated Hudson Theatre to the ranks of Broadway houses after a half-century absence, is an excellent example of why less is often more."", 'The same could not be said for the lavish Hudson Theatre itself, and its comfortable new seats; the opulent lobby is embellished with elaborate decorative molding and studded with Tiffany stained glass light fixtures, while the lush theatre interior is a somewhat more subdued, tiered palace of cream paneling accented with blue, green and gold mosaic tile clusters. The contrast between this Gilded Age show-palace and the Spartan, almost concert-style production onstage could not be more dramatic, but make no mistake about it: this Sunday In The Park With George is a jewel in its own right, radiant with talent, and shimmering with color and light.', 'A red-hot transfer from off-Broadway\'s New York City Center, this anticipated revival features Jake Gyllenhaal and Annaleigh Ashford in a limited run, heading a stellar, multi-ethnic supporting cast composed of veterans like Robert Sean Leonard, Penny Fuller, Philip Boykin and Ruthie Ann Miles, as well as Sondheim\'s achingly beautiful musical score, in a pared-down concert version, staged with rigorous simplicity by Ms. Lapine in front of an onstage orchestra. Beowulf Boritt\'s smart set design, a gently raked bare stage bordered by an upstage scrim, becomes the blank canvas of the artist Georges Seurat (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is working to bring order, design and composition to his famous pointillist masterpiece, ""A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,"" while his favorite model and live-in lover, Dot (Annaleigh Ashford), competes vainly for his attention. Seurat\'s struggle between his art and his life with Dot forms the central conflict of the first act, while the second act shifts a century ahead to his descendant, George, the sculptor of a series of electronic displays of light and sound he calls Chromolumes. This George is wrestling with his inability to express himself in a new way while still competing for various commissions to finance his complicated and expensive Chromolumes in today\'s commercial art world. A trip to the present-day Paris on L\'Ile de la Jatte to install a Chromolume exhibition brings George back full circle to his famous forbearer and to an insightful final reunion with Dot as well as a fuller understanding of his need to move on as an artist and a man.', 'From the thrilling, familiar, opening arpeggiated chords of Sunday In The Park With George, itself a masterpiece, to the final, heart-breaking crescendo in the resplendent finale, this production will hold you enraptured throughout and leave you nearly spent of all emotion at its conclusion. During the crescendo of the act one finale, ""Sunday,"" as Seurat\'s painting achieves its finished, concentrated realization of composition, balance and harmony, I was, quite literally, shaking in my seat. Mr. Gyllenhaal\'s performance of ""Finishing The Hat"" alone is worth the price of admission; who had any idea that he could sing so well? He is more than matched by the superb, tour-de-force turn of Ms. Ashford, whose devastating rendition of ""We Do Not Belong Together"" brought the Hudson Theatre\'s audience to its knees, and whose delivery of the second act\'s ""Move On"" made for herself a place in the pantheon of all-time great Broadway performances, no lie. Talk about not a dry eye in the house, even the ushers were weeping openly.', 'Under the direction of Chris Fenwick, the orchestra performs brilliantly, with orchestrations by Michael Starobin, and while the production elements are select, they are telling, with excellent costumes by Clint Ramos and light design by the ever-amazing Ken Billington. Chromolume #7, before it malfunctions (as it is scripted to do) is a visual knockout, but to tell the truth, it is just some lights suspended from the ceiling of the theatre. Less is more.', ""This is doubtless going to become the hottest ticket in town, but you are nonetheless here encouraged to snag one by any means possible. I don't want to overstate myself, but that would be difficult to do: this is a production for the ages, as good as it gets, a performance so exceptional, so overwhelming, you might be lucky enough to see something like it once, maybe twice in a lifetime."", '(Michael Hillyer)', '""He is a thorny soul, a man neither happy nor particularly kind, and not someone you\'d be likely to befriend. But when the 19th-century French painter Georges Seurat, reincarnated in the solitary flesh by a laser-focused Jake Gyllenhaal, demands that you look at the world as he does, it\'s impossible not to fall in love. Or something deeper than love — closer to religious gratitude — is the sentiment you may experience in the finale that concludes the first act of the marvelous revival of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s \'Sunday in the Park With George.\'""', ' ', 'Ben Brantley for New York Times', '""Jake Gyllenhaal\'s got it, by George!

So why the ""hate"" part? It\'s the company\'s approach to theater that distresses me. ""The Lion King,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and ""Tarzan"" are all merely merchandising vehicles, created primarily as a launching pad for toys, dolls, and theme-park rides.', 'This business strategy makes the musicals the stars -- the actors are commodities.

Adhering closely to P. L. Travers' novels, there is substance to this story not found in the film version. Rebecca Luker and Daniel Jenkins are superb as Mr. and Mrs. Banks, and their marital woes and George's painful childhood go far in making this story interesting to grownups."", ""Gavin Lee gives a jubilant performance as Bert (worthy successor to Dick Van Dyke), as do Jane Carr as Mrs. Brill (the cook), and Ruth Gottschall as Miss Andrew (George's sadistic nanny)."", 'The sets, as you would expect, are imaginative and complicated, an engineering feat to be sure, the choreography inventive and spirited, and the music. . . well . . . supercallifragiliistic -- you know. ""Mary Poppins"" will play forever, just like Disney\'s other shows, with unknown actors shuffled through the roles like interns. And anyone with a pretty face and a pleasant voice can be Mary.', ""Most children, however, really don't know the difference between great and mediocre performances, and they will love the show, as will you because, in the end, you'll enjoy seeing your children have such a good time."", 'Tickets, or course, are difficult to get right now, but by January or February, when things are slow in the Theatre District, and New York is gray and dreary, you should be able to snag a few for your family.

And the reply, ""Oh but I love that song. And she nails it."" ""OK. How about the one where she defends her love life."" ""Nope. We need that one because she\'s been silent up till then."" And on and on and on. In the end everything stayed because all the elements were too dear. No one had the laser vision to make the cuts. Even the song ""I Love You Like A Table"" - the title speaks for itself...', 'To use the pie analogy that begins the show, this team took sugar, butter, flour and added chocolate, cinnamon, lemons, ginger, molasses, minced meat and... you get the idea.', 'On the plus side of everything is Jesse Mueller whose skill at delivering a whole universe in a song is astonishing. Her range is stratospheric and her heart is in every note. As Jenna, she is the waitress who supplies Joe\'s Diner with pies that are not just pies. Each one is life. ""Deep Dish Blueberry Bacon"" ""Betrayed by My Eggs Pie"". Some are real, others are fantasy, like ""My Husband\'s A Jerk Chicken Pot Pie"".', 'Jenna is one of those women who never gets a leg up. The kind of woman who will not be able to afford a ticket to this show. She married because there was not much else to do. And now her husband has devolved into a self-pitying Neanderthal named Earl (Nick Cordero). At work Jenna is buoyed up by the other waitresses. Dawn (Kimiko Glenn) is a perky waif who would like to be in love but has no idea how to do it. Becky (Keala Settle) is a woman with a lot of mileage who still has plenty of tread on her tires. The cook Cal (Eric Anderson) is a monosyllabic soul of hidden substance. The owner Joe (a delightful as always Dakin Matthews) wears gruff like an impenetrable suit and misses nothing. His solo ""Take It From An Old Man"" left the audience moved so much we almost forgot to clap. Then there are the customers who dance and sing through life.', ""In other words there is nothing new here. Except for the arrival of the local gynecologist Dr. Pomatter (Drew Gehling) to whose office Jenna bolts when she learns she is pregnant with a child she does not want because a) it is Earl's and b) she is pretty certain she will mess up being a mother. The highly improbable relationship that develops between doctor and patient is made plausible, once again, because of the music. Their several duets are exquisite, and when it comes to being funny, Gehling walks away with the trophy."", 'Eventually Jenna gets her courage back, and the balcony erupts with applause. Not so much in the orchestra where I imagine there were a lot of women seeing themselves on that stage: in an unhappy relationship with future prospects looking dim. The walking wounded.', 'And that is where the bravery of this show lies: in the tale of a woman who is living her life by putting one foot in front of the other every day. She has dreams. In this show a dream does not make you delusional. A dream is a soft place to land.', 'And in the end that is why we cry and that is why we cheer.

The Phantom of the Opera,"Join me for a little jaunt down memory lane to a magical place that is alive and well. Andrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, directed by theatre legend Harold Prince and produced by Cameron Mackintosh and The Really Useful Group, is the longest-running show in Broadway history. A recent revisit to this lavish production got me to thinking about what it takes to make a show age so beautifully."", 'Well, you start with a story that reeks of sexuality, mystery, innocence and passion. Then you add music that weaves motif after motif together in a manner that even a tone deaf person could grasp. Add impeccable design - 19th century costumes and a set that is so enormous it dwarfs the cast and so spectacular that you can hardly keep track of where you are. Top it off with staging that is actor proof and voila!', ""When I say actor-proof, I don't mean that this cast is in any way deficient. Indeed, each is an impeccable performer. The three principals have spectacular voices that span several octaves, and each knows exactly how to deliver the goods. Julia Urdine as Christine is no shrinking violet. She is a young woman who opens her heart and her voice to whatever adventure the world offers, including the power and dark magic of the Phantom. Jeremy Hays (Raoul) has the difficult job of playing second romantic fiddle to the Phantom, and he manoeuvers up that river without flagging for an instant. James Barbour (the 15th Phantom on Broadway) is menacing and vulnerable, and his passion takes up the entire stage whenever he is on it. Watching him in person one realizes that singing with a mask and several layers of latex on your face is no easy feat. Barbour, however makes it look so."", 'The Phantom of the Opera, based on the classic novel by Gaston Leroux, is the story of a man who was born with a horribly deformed face. He hides in the bowels of a Paris opera house where he toys with and torments the occupants just because he can. When he hears Christine Daaé sing, however, his heart bursts open and he dedicates himself to nurturing her talent. Soon the Phantom is overtaken by his own passion for Christine as a woman and a singer, and he becomes reckless. He shows her his lair in the river below the city. He reveals his love for her. She responds in kind, until she sees his face. Still, their connection remains inviolable, even when Christine tumbles for Raoul. The Phantom makes demands on her behalf and declares war on the opera house when his demands are not met. Everything comes to a head, with Raoul becoming the pawn. The lovers are allowed to live and the Phantom - well, who knows what happened to him?', 'This story has it all: music that stays with you long after the curtain comes down (yes I bought the CD), love in an array of colors, fantasy, danger, sex, hopes and dreams. The Phantom of the Opera remains a stunning production that engages the ear, the eye and the heart. The fact that it has done so for nearly 30 years world wide is testament to the crafty craft of making theatre. Theatre is ultimately a magic show, and one of the reasons being human is such a gas.', 'Got a friend coming into town? Take her to see this one. You won\'t be disappointed one little bit. And when you buy the music I won\'t say, ""I told you so."" Promise.', '(Photo by Matthew Murphy)', '""It may be possible to have a terrible time at The Phantom of the Opera, but you\'ll have to work at it. Only a terminal prig would let the avalanche of pre-opening publicity poison his enjoyment of this show, which usually wants nothing more than to shower the audience with fantasy and fun, and which often succeeds, at any price. The physical production, Andrew Bridge\'s velvety lighting included, is a tour de force throughout—as extravagant of imagination as of budget.""', 'Frank Rich for New York Times', '""It is a spectacular entertainment, visually the most impressive of the British musicals. Perhaps the most old-fashioned thing about it is it\'s a love story, something Broadway has not seen for quite a while. To say the score is Lloyd Webber\'s best is not saying a great deal. His music always has a synthetic, borrowed quality to it. As you listen you find yourself wondering where you\'ve heard it before. In this case you\'ve heard a lot of it in Puccini, in the work of other Broadway composers and even the Beatles. Nevertheless he seems to be borrowing from better sources, and he has much greater sophistication about putting it all together. There are some droll opera parodies, several beautiful songs, an impressive septet and a grand choral number, all richly orchestrated.""', 'Howard Kissel for New York Daily News', '""Technically it is a piece of impeccably crafted musical theater, with theme, music and staging in perfect accord.

""The Phantom Of The Opera"" is romantic musical theater hokum in the grand manner - hokum cordon blue - and it justifies the feverish buildup that has given it a $16,500,000 advance. It\'s good for a Broadway run of several years. Andrew Lloyd Webber has taken the Gaston Leroux potboiler about the love-crazed disfigured genius who lives in the catacombs of the Paris Opera and fashioned it into a thrilling and musically rich mass legit entertainment. The 19th century period spectacle, scenic legerdemain, soaring melodies and exceptional singing are at the service of an involving and piquantly offbeat love story, all of it staged with brilliantly organized flair by Harold Prince, back in top form.""', 'Richard Hummler for Variety', 'External links to full reviews from popular press...', 'New York Times', ' - ', 'New York Daily News', ' - ', 'Variety'",5,Excellent,(Photo by Matthew Murphy)
Dear Evan Hansen,"When my eyes are wet and it's all I can do to not join the dialogue on the stage and my giggle box has completely turned over, I am having a really really good time. This reviewer is not a huge fan of musicals by any means - too much distraction and not enough story in most cases - but "", 'Dear Evan Hansen', ' is a show that holds you tight with its honesty of story told in a way that delights you to your very toes.', 'Every aspect of what you see, hear and feel hums in perfect harmony throughout the piece. The songs, by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, are poetic expressions of real human stuff that dove tails perfectly with the storytelling. Nowhere to be found is that smile-and-move-your-hands song break that must be endured before we get back to the meat of the matter.', 'The shame of being human is never more tender than when one is in high school. Our hero, Evan Hansen (Ben Platt), is a sweet senior in high school who is socially challenged, prescription medicated, adored by his single mother, Heidi Hanson (Rachel Bay Jones), has a therapist and has a crush on a girl named Zoe Murphy (Laura Dreyfuss). We want Evan to win because he is just totes adorbs as he struggles to express himself, control his outbursts and fulfill expectations to complete the assignment his therapist gave him this week - to write an encouraging letter to himself every day. Platt is perfection as that kid you remember from your high school, whom you likely owe a huge apology, as he chokes on nearly every word before it bursts out of him loaded with the urgency only a teenager can assign to his own expression.', ""The unrequited Zoe's family is a mother, Cynthia Murphy (Jennifer Laura Thompson), father, Larry Murphy (Michael Park) and a brother, Connor Murphy (Mike Faist). Connor is also socially challenged and prone to outbursts. But Connor is self-medicated and at war with his parents who are at war with one another. Zoe does her best to avoid the cross-fire."", 'These mothers have something in common and the song ""Anybody Have A Map?"" can only bring the damp eyes of recognition to many of us also wishing our special needs kids came with manuals. I\'ve met the mothers Jones and Thompson are and I\'ve put on the masks they do to face the world and hide the complete lack of clue we have about our matriarchal responsibilities.', ""Connor and Evan have a run in between classes at school which is verbally hurtful and ends in Connor shoving Evan to the floor. Zoe tries to smooth things over in a scene saturated with teenage angst, misunderstanding and vulnerability, which is, of course, very funny. Dreyfuss is beautiful. Her voice and manner are the romantic poetry you remember from when you idealized young love. You will fall hard for her. Later, when it looks like the boys might mend, Connor finds one of Evan's letters on a printer in the lab at school. The letter describes Evan's hope for a future with Zoe. Connor, at first, thinks this is seriously creepy and then with the warp speed of a bored teen looking for a problem, Connor decides this is a ruse by Evan to upset him enough to stimulate another rage episode and make everyone else in school think Connor is crazy. Faist is flawless as he gives us the really hard to love boy teen narcissistic asshole who misdirects his passion against his own best interests. We know this kid, too. He's the one who didn't make it."", ""And this is only the beginning of the misunderstanding of Evan's letter to himself, which quickly becomes public - nay, let's modernize that; it goes viral. Writer, Steven Levenson, has given us a story that could be told around a dinner table right now. Social media is cast in the role of Monster Maker."", 'I cannot bear to give any more away as ', 'Dear Evan Hansen', ', in my opinion, is required viewing, but I do want to shout out a few more nuggets about the production before I leave you with orders to immediately purchase your tickets. Evan\'s friend-because-the-family-says-he\'s-a friend, Jared Kleinman (Will Roland), is a power house of comic expression charged with extreme mischief. Kleinman wrecked my kidneys with laughter. Connor\'s ""acquaintance,"" Alana Beck (Kristolyn Lloyd), is the poseur girl you knew in school. Lloyd exposes the loneliness of that girl causing you to, of all things, forgive her. The first dancing sequence, choreographed by Danny Mefford. between Jared, Connor and Evan is a total squeal; I wanted to see it again immediately. Thompson brilliantly portrays an irrationally hopeful mother so well that, even though we know she is deceived, we catch ourselves coming along with it. Platt\'s performance is beyond sublime - every reviewer will tell you this. But the added bonus is the stunningly beautiful work of Jones. The journey Heidi Hanson takes in this story is the most transformative of all the characters and Jones acts without a filter giving us every ugly and beautiful detail of her character\'s growth shamelessly.', 'The songs and dance in this show move the story forward - thank you, God - rather than stopping the action and causing you to look at your watch. Two hours and twenty-five minutes fly by and this musical poo-pooer wished there had been more. Yes. Really. Also, the scenic design by David Korins and the lighting design by Japhy Weideman work in the most perfect concert of technical genius I have ever seen in any production ever.

Even before the curtain rises we are anticipating a stupendous Mary Poppins, who with the aid of a strong east wind will transport us into a magical realm where ï¿½Anything Can Happenï¿½ if you let it.', 'The musical is not a strict film to stage transfer, with the story having been cleverly adapted by Julian Fellowes from both the film persona of Mary Poppins and the one created in the books by Poppinsï¿½ author Ms Travers. The musicalï¿½s book is about a dysfunctional family based around Mr Banks, a man incapable of both giving and receiving love and affection as a result of being heavily dosed, as a child, on a foul concoction of cod-liver oil, brimstone and treacle by his tyrannical nanny, Miss Andrew. It is to this sad family with its two unruly children, Jane and Michael that Mary Poppins mysteriously arrives to dispense ï¿½A Spoonful of Sugarï¿½, with which to sweeten family relations.', 'Bob Crowleyï¿½s stage design dramatically reveals different levels of the Banks family home, as the action moves from the ground to the lower and upper levels and finally to the rooftops.', 'The music is everything one expects, containing the well-loved melodies of the Sherman Brothers.

To aid the adaptation made to the story by Fellowes, some new musical scores were needed and these have been provided by the British composer-lyricist duo George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, and not always to the showï¿½s credit. Stiles and Drewe capture the same magical melodic simplicity of the Sherman Brotherï¿½s with the delightful tune ï¿½Practically Perfectï¿½, but not so with the remainder of their songs.

When she sings that she is ï¿½Practically perfect in every wayï¿½, it is hard to disagree, as she creates an enigmatic endearing personality that is sure to find her Mary Poppins a place in every childï¿½s heart. Gavin Lee equally shines as the cockney Bert, Mary Poppins similarly mysterious friend, who also has the remarkable habit of suddenly turning up when needed.', 'David Haig gives a superb performance as ï¿½George Banksï¿½, who makes the transformational journey from emotional cripple to happy father, giving the production its dramatic edge.

Cirque Dreams: Jungle Fantasy,"A Review by ', 'Barbara Mehlman and Geri Manus', '.', 'Every year, Broadway offers us a surprise. A few years ago, the puppets of ""Avenue Q"" were the big hit. This season we\'ve seen a green-faced monster do a soft-shoe in ï¿½Young Frankenstein,ï¿½ mermaids and crabs glide across the stage in ï¿½Little Mermaid,ï¿½ Greek roller-skating muses in ï¿½Xanadu,ï¿½ and now a circus, minus, thankfully, the smelly animals. ï¿½Cirque Dreams Jungle Fantasyï¿½ has come to Broadway.', 'ï¿½Cirque Dreamsï¿½ is the latest production of Neil Goldbergï¿½s Cirque Productions, creators of international performance and touring sensations, ""Cirque Ingenieux,"" ""Cirque Dreams Coobrila,"" and ""Cirque Dreams Illumination."" Since 1993, it has been the companyï¿½s mission to blend European circus artistry with Broadway theatricality, and to a large extent, Goldberg has succeeded.', '""Cirque Dreams "" is visually stunning, with gorgeous detailed costumes and backdrops reminiscent of a Peter Maxx psychedelic trip to an imaginary exotic playland. From the opening in which huge turtle-like beings crawl across the stage, to the prancing squawking ostriches, to the luminescent owls, this production has us enthralled with its inventiveness. Add to this the balletic butterflies, the no-doubt invertebrate lizard-like contortionists, balancing giraffes, and the fantasy flyers, and you have the makings of a great acrobatic, aesthetically exquisite family show.', 'The question is: Why Broadway? Did Goldberg lose his way en route to Madison Square Garden or Radio City Music Hall just as ""Blast!,"" the half-time drill-team extravaganza, did seven years ago? Nothing like it has ever been done on a Broadway stage before, so why now?', ""Goldberg has a not-very-secret ulterior motive: winning a Tony for Best Special Theatrical Event, a new category created for anomalies such as this that don't fit into the traditional slots of Best Play or Best Musical. Weï¿½ll have to wait till next year to see if his own fantasies are fulfilled, but for the savvy five-year-old boy sitting behind us, his were. He was dazzled -- and so were the grandparents."", '""Cirque Dreams Jungle Fantasy"" is an American creation, and not to be confused with ""Cirque du Soleil"" which originated in Quebec, and is geared towards more mature, more sophisticated audiences. But that doesn\'t mean it\'s just for kids. You\'ll be amazed at the acrobatic feats and utter strength of the performers, hold your breath as the trapeze artists fly above the stage, and gasp as the 3-D human propelled tetrahedrons twirl with abandon to soaring musical accompaniment.

Miss Saigon,"Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg's Miss Saigon has taken its second helicopter ride across the Atlantic from London, and landed right back at the Broadway Theatre, where it first set down in 1991 under heavy enemy fire. The anti-aircraft artillery at that time came not from the Viet Cong, as would befit an epic musical set in the final days of the Vietnam War, but from Actors Equity and the Asian-American community, who objected to the casting of a white actor (Jonathan Pryce) in a Eurasian role. Cameron Mackintosh, the show's producer then and now, threatened at the time to abort the mission, but after coming to terms, he managed to land his imported mega-musical safely, with all hands on board, where it afterward hovered over Broadway for ten successful years. It also enjoyed a 10-year run at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London, and has been performed in 28 countries in 15 different languages, so the reason for its re-appearance right now isn't readily apparent. To heck with that pesky Immigration controversy that is now confronting the nation, the big chopper is back, blowing up dust in a ramped-up new production directed by the talented Laurence Connor. The casting of Jon Jon Briones, a Filipino chorus member of the original London production, as The Engineer, a role more or less made infamous by Jonathan Pryce, has quieted the casting issues, and in the title role that launched the amazing Lea Salonga's career, the young newcomer Eva Noblezada is simply sensational as Kim, the war-orphaned teenager who winds up working for The Engineer in his garish Saigon den of vice, Dreamland."", ""The story is loosely based on Puccini's 1904 opera Madama Butterfly, with the setting transposed to 1975 Saigon on the eve of the American evacuation from Vietnam. While the tragic love sequence in both remains identical (boy meets girl, boy loses girl, girl has little boy), dropping the action into the wild context of Saigon in the last days of the Vietnam War allows the show's creative team to swirl a cynical mist around the immigrant dream of coming to America, with a vision of the real American dream as something bloated and empty. From its viewpoint on the ground in Southeast Asia, America is depicted in Miss Saigon as the departing imperial force heedless of the collateral carnage it has left behind in its wake. The famous Act Two helicopter is an apt, if gaudy, symbol for that; the same could be said of the male protagonist, a young U.S. Marine, Chris (Alistair Brammer), who is forced to abandon his (even younger) Vietnamese sex-shop bride Kim without knowing what will become of her, or even that he has fathered a child with her. Like Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly, Chris later returns to Asia (with his wife) to reclaim his son, and just as in Butterfly, well, let's just say you won't need night-goggles to see the helipad coming."", 'Nevertheless, the story packs an unavoidable emotional punch, even if you do see it coming, largely due to the performance of Ms. Noblezada. She is so entirely connected to her character, to Kim\'s grit and resolve, and to her youthful love for Chris and for her son, that she carries you along with her, just as she carries the soaring ballads and anthems the score asks her to deliver throughout the show. She simply nails all of it, and there is little question that this new production of Miss Saigon has produced yet another bona-fide star. Jon Jon Briones is doubtless giving the best performance of his long career, and he seems to be enjoying every nanosecond of it. His performance is a creepy treat, from start to finish, chock-full of details and nuance, totally in control, even when things get out of control. He delivers the big production numbers with mad aplomb, especially the over-the-top eleven o\'clock number, ""The American Dream,"" in which he competes for attention with the entrance of a gigantic Statue of Liberty, which regurgitates an enormous white vintage Cadillac that is even longer than the line at the ladies room at intermission.', ""The large cast is uniformly excellent, and given the epic scope of the production the efforts of the versatile ensemble are nothing short of Herculean. Alistair Brammer is a bit stiff physically, but he more than makes up for that with sincerity and an excellent singing voice, and stand-outs in the main supporting roles include a solid Nicholas Christopher (John) and Devin Ilaw (Thuy), who sets a very high bar, vocally, for the rest of the cast. The design elements are appropriately impressive, propelling the story along to its inevitable conclusion, with protean sets by Totie Driver and Matt Kinley, based on a design concept by Adrian Vaux; lights by Bruno Poet, and costumes by Andreane Neofitou. Bob Avian's musical staging, with additional choreography by Geoffrey Garratt, is seamless, in the commercial Broadway sense, inseparable from Mr. Connor's staging and masterful in its own right. The pop-rock score, by Claude-Michel Schonberg, is sometimes tepid and often repetitive, but when it has to soar it does so, usually on the wings of Eva Noblezada's beautiful soprano voice."", ""This production, while dated, is not without tooth, and at its best moments, usually in its big production numbers, it can still deliver plenty of bite. But the larger problem is that the world has changed since 1991; today's reality places Miss Saigon, with its lurid immigration nightmare of a crass, hollow American dream not really worth having, oddly out of context with a world in which millions of refugees are desperately seeking shelter in an America that is now officially seeking to ban them."", '(Photo by Matthew Murphy)', '""It\'s not as if such stories don\'t still have the power to stir suspense and tears. But this eventful, sung-through production out of London, directed by Laurence Connor, feels about as affecting as a historical diorama, albeit a lavishly appointed one.""', 'Ben Brantley for New York Times', '""This bracing new production from London reminds that whirlybirds can\'t whip up emotions. Only good actors can do that. The revival of the musical by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil (\'Les Miserables\') has plenty of them.""', 'Joe Dziemianowicz for New York Daily News', '""Miss Saigon is ultimately stranded between extremes of cynicism and idealism: the Engineer\'s cartoonish hunger for American-style excess versus Kim\'s bland, maternal purity. What\'s lost in between is humanity or ambiguity, songs to tell us more about the characters\' past, their quirks or inner nuances. Instead, stereotyped villains and victims shout-sing at each others\' faces or collapse and bellow, ""Nooooo!"" (twice). Diversity on Broadway should be celebrated, but give actors of color characters we all can care about.""', 'David Cote for Time Out New York', '""This is a most worthy revival, and now, minus the controversy, fans are free to re-live the thrill.""', 'Roma Torre for NY1', '""This is brawny, crowd-pleasing entertainment with a cast of 36 and an 18-piece orchestra.

Review of Christmas Spectacular starring The Radio City Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall,"Yes, it's (already) that time of the year again, folks! We haven't even carved the Thanksgiving turkey yet, but that doesn't stop those fabulous Rockettes from donning a sparkling outfit or two and bringing us their annual Christmas Spectacular once again. No siree bub!"", ""Last night, I found myself in the vast Radio City Music Hall, sat across the aisle from an 8-year old boy and how I wished I could have been in his shoes for the night. Childhood should be brimming with awe, wonder and magic, and for this little theatre-goer, last night's entertainment was delivering that by the glittering bucket-load. Seeing a child's face light up as Santa enters the room and seeing his eyes beam as three dozen Santas follow (a group of gender-bending, disguised Rockettes) and seeing those same eyes nearly pop out of his head in amazement as those present are joined by an army of tightly choreographed Santas (by way of the huge LED backdrop) is simply priceless. Oh to be young again."", ""Let's make no mistake about it, this is the obligatory festive treat for the children of New York and those visiting. It's not, on the other hand, a must for all of us hardened musical theatre fans. There isn't much of a narrative to follow, rather Santa acts as a sort of jolly compère to shoe in those iconic dance numbers, some of which have probably been seen every year since 1933. The Sugarplum Fairy (now a giant teddy bear with diva aspirations) and The Nutcracker are still traditional favourites, whilst the modern child demands a theme-park style 3D projected movie (glasses provided) of Santa's sleigh and reindeer hurtling around the famous sights of Manhattan or remote-controlled floating snowflake beach-balls. Admittedly, there was also one or two moments when my own jaw dropped in disbelief - mainly with the inclusion of real sheep, camels and a donkey on the stage. They were, of course, main attractions in the Nativity scene, which sadly seemed a little out of place amongst the bombarding commercial aspects of Christmas. Where do those animals go between shows, I wonder? Do they take a gentle stroll down 5th Avenue?"", ""The Rockettes, as ever, remain the epitome of dance troupe perfection and dazzle in their elaborate costumes, beautifully designed by Gregg Barnes, Frank Krenz and Martin Pakledinaz. My date for the evening couldn't help but notice though how little they reflect the multi-racial city they call home with just two or three girls of colour. Yes, this really is a White Christmas, folks. But racial politics aside - and goodness knows, we have had more than our fair share of that recently - if you can embrace the child within, you can embrace the Christmas Spectacular."", 'Grab your kids or your young relatives and treat them to this all-singing, all-dancing, multi-media-spewing Winter Wonderland, which will no doubt remain with them for years and years to come.', '(Photo by Dan Niver)'",3,Good,(Photo by Dan Niver)
White Christmas,"A Review by ', 'Barbara Mehlman and Geri Manus', '.', 'In 1942, Irving Berlin signed a contract with Paramount to write songs for a film with Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire called ""Holiday Inn."" It was expected that the big single to come out of that movie would be ""Be Careful, It\'s My Heart,"" but things didn\'t turn out that way. The blockbuster hit from the movie was ""White Christmas.""', 'Some 12 years later, Bing was back, teamed up with Danny Kaye, Rosie Clooney and Vera-Ellen to make ""White Christmas,"" a black-and-white film that has since been colorized, and still brings tears to the eyes of those who remember when. Now on Broadway, you have a full-color version of ""White Christmas"" on stage, and it will also bring tears to your eyes also, but only from excessive yawning, not joy.', 'Maybe the film evokes wonderful memories, but the show is tired, despite some fine renditions of classic American standards: ""How Deep Is the Ocean,"" ""Sisters,"" Happy Holidays,"" ""Count Your Blessings,"" and of course, ""White Christmas.""', 'Seeing these standards come alive is eye candy for the holiday depressed, especially if you harbor a secret fondness for crinolines, tuxes, and the halcyon days of the \'50s when all was right with the world. In ""White Christmas,"" it is 1954, and the now famous song-and dance team of Bob Wallace and Phil Davis, friends since they entertained the troops together during World War II, is supposedly flying to Florida to enjoy the weather and a gig for the holidays.', ""But first they take a detour to see Betty and Judy, a sister act, before they leave for warmer climes and Phil is smitten. He wants the girls (they didn't call 'em women in those days) to join their act but they've already committed to a gig in Vermont. Since Phil is in charge of travel arrangements, he tricks Bob into thinking he's on the train to Florida, and he doesn't find out he 's going north instead of south until it's too late."", ""When they get to the Vermont inn, the guys discover the innkeeper is their old General Waverly from the War and he's down on his luck financially. No snow. No guests. Lots of unpaid bills. Bob secretly sends out an SOS to all the guys in their company and invites them to the inn to surprise the General and everybody lives happily ever after and all the bills get paid."", 'While all this is going on, in an equally tired subplot, Phil keeps trying to fix Bob up with a girl but he\'s sour on love -- girls are ""too much like the weather."" Of course, this is a challenge for Phil and Bob falls for one of the sisters. Clearly Bob is easily duped.', 'Perhaps thatï¿½s the major drawback to this stage rendition of an iconic movie: the story itself is insipid. Except for the two outstanding production numbers of ""I Love a Piano"" and ""Blue Skies,"" the rest is clichï¿½ and a bit too fluffy for modern tastes.', ""Stephen Bogardus plays a debonair Bob, but heï¿½s neither a Josh Groban heart throb nor a Bing Crosby crooner. As for Jeffry Denman who plays the girl-crazy Phil, he's cool but lacks the humor and infectiousness of Danny Kaye. Kerry Oï¿½Malley and Meredith Patterson as OK as Betty and Judy, but this is not your A-list cast."", 'A fitting ending to this show would have been seeing a bunch of soldiers in uniform march down the aisles of the orchestra to surprise the General onstage.

Grease,"The conductor struck up the band, but the audience was already screaming. After all, many audience members who watched the television auditions for the third revival of ""Grease,"" the iconic greaser classic, may have voted for the people they were about to see on the stage.', 'For those of you who didn\'t tune in to the reality show, ""Grease: You\'re the One That I Want,"" this is what happened. A bunch of star-struck youngsters who believed in themselves and their talent heeded the open call for a man and woman to play teenagers Danny Zuko and Sandy Dumbrowski, the roles created by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John in the hit film.', 'Among the thousands who auditioned, 20 of mediocre talent (that was the best they got) were selected to perform on successive Sundays, and at the end of each show, people called in to vote for their favorites. The following week, one man and one woman was eliminated based on the votes till the two winners were left: Laura Osnes and Max Crumm, now starring in Broadway.', 'Crumm\'s claim to fame is -- well, he has none, never having appeared on stage before, but Osnes, more experienced, did play the role of Sandy at Chanhassen Dinner theatre in Minnesota. Yes, a point is being made here, albeit a sarcastic one. Casting is an art, and when the right people are in the right roles, everyone glows and the live theater experience is exhilarating. Unfortunately, it doesn\'t come together in this dull incarnation of ""Grease.""', ""For lack of a better word, Crumm is just ordinary. Nice guy, kinda sweet, but merely someone working hard at acting, singing and dancing sans Travolta's charisma. Osnes, on the other hand, actually is talented but has a ways to go before she's ready for the big time. As for chemistry, this couple are simply two inert elements -- they don't connect with each other, or the audience."", 'The other problem is, the ""reality"" part has nothing to do with the reality of the saga of ""Grease."" The supporting cast, playing Rizzo, Kenickie, Frenchy and other members of the T-Birds and Pink Ladies, resemble more the parents of high school greasers than teenagers -- the only way they could look like they go to Rydell High School is if they were Super Seniors for many, many years.', ""The songs are still sing-along; the voices, especially those of Osnes, and Jenny Powers (Rizzo), are strong; and Kathleen Marshall's choreography is just right for the high school crowd. But the stage is too small and shallow for this production. It's hard to have a real dance contest when only six contestants can actually fit on the stage at one time."", 'And then there\'s the story -- cut up, doctored, and rearranged. The subplot takes over the main plot, so it\'s Kenickie and Rizzo who dominate. ""Look at Me, I\'m Sandra Dee"" has been misplaced. Sandy\'s ""Devoted to You"" is too little, and way too late. And if you\'re waiting for the great car, Grease Lightning, to have any meaning ï¿½ watch the movie instead.

But ""Shrek the Musical"" is more than a feel-good children\'s story with a twist: it digs deep into our inner mush to find out where inner beauty lies and how we recognize our self-worth.', 'Based on William Steig\'s 1990 children\'s book that became the Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature, ""Shrek the Musical"" goes much further than similar cartoon movies, such as ""Beauty and the Beast."" After all, if the beast gets someone to love him for who he is, the spell is then broken and he turns into the handsome prince. Underneath Shrek\'s grungy, pot-bellied green décor and innate grouchiness is, well, Shrek, and he doesn\'t turn into anything.', 'Told at the tender age of seven by his parents that there are friends and fortunes to be made in this ""Big, Bright, Beautiful World,"" but not for him \'cause he\'s too ugly, they send Shrek away to find his own way in the world and caution him not to scare too many people or he may get killed. So with a face that not even a mother can love, Shrek retreats to a disgusting swamp where no one can criticize his ogre-like ways.', ""One of those ways is eating trespassers, but there come too many to count. All the fairy tale characters we've grown up with, led by Pinocchio, explain that they've been banished by Lord Farquaad from the Kingdom of Duloc and Shrek is next for displacement. Holding his deed to the swamp, Shrek sets out to meet the less than regal prince and fight."", ""To get the intruders off his land, Shrek agrees to be little Lord Farquaad's knight and rescue Princess Fiona from the tower surrounded by lava and guarded by a fire-breathing dragon, for only if he marries a real live princess can he become king."", ""And why would a beautiful princess be locked in a tower for 20 years, missing all those royal balls and lessons in social graces? Because she's under a spell of course. She's also no ordinary princess. Having been just as isolated as Shrek, her behavior is decidedly un-princess-y. Fiona's a jeans and flannel shirt kind of gal, and she wants a pre-nup. So when she and Shrek journey to Farquaad's castle, it doesn't surprise him that she goes into hiding as soon as the sun goes down. He doesn't' know it's the curse: she would take the form of her true love, when she finds him. And you know who it turns out to be."", ""In this multifaceted tale, nothing is as it seems. Layers of defense mechanisms are broken down and twisted inside-out till the characters meet their demons, both real and imagined, and conquer their fears once and for all. Learning to love one's self, and learning to love others for the content of their character, not the color of their skin (in this case, green), is the message that rings loud and clear."", 'Singing those messages is the amazing Sutton Foster who gives Fiona her edge. Brian D\'Arcy James plays Shrek with heart and soul, covering up his own handsomeness to discover his character\'s deeper meanings. Daniel Breaker, who recently played Stu\'s young alter-ego in ""Passing Strange,"" makes Donkey a real sassy ass. And Christopher Sieber\'s knees get quite a workout playing the diminutive Lord Farquaad.', '""Shrek the Musical"" delights and works with an upbeat score by Jeanine Tesori, and moving book and lyrics by David Lindsay-Abaire.

Bandstand,"Bandstand is a musical that treads the razor\'s edge - is it a romance or is it a veterans\' salute? It is both, and makes no apologies. At times it also makes no sense, but the underpinning, which is the cost of war, carries the day. The opening number ""Just Like It Was Before"" puts us on notice that the world is filled with double meanings. Set in Cleveland in the latter half of 1945, this is the story of one G.I., Pfc. Donny Novitski (Corey Cott) who makes it home with all his ghosts in tact. One of them was his best pal, Michael. Donny was there when Michael died - they were stationed in the Pacific - and now that he is home he does what he promised he would do and visits Michael\'s widow Julia Trojan (Laura Osnes). And before you go any further, yes, I too wondered at this last name. No explanation is ever given, and this unfortunate choice stands out like, well, you know.', 'Donny is a piano man (as is Cott, and how refreshing it is to see these actors playing their own instruments). Aside from being instantly smitten by Julia (of course) he is also looking for work. He hits upon an idea to enter a contest with a band that not only will play FOR the vets but be made up entirely of vets. One by one he pulls these men in, Nick (Alex Bender), Johnny (Joe Carroll), Davy (Brandon James Ellis), Jimmy (James Nathan Hopkins), and Wayne (Geoff Packard). They, too, have their ghosts. One drinks too much. One is suicidal. One has memory lapses. All varying forms of what we would today call PTSD, but what was, back in the day, swept under the rug. The soldiers coming home form WWII had no listeners for their trauma. They were expected to come home, celebrate, breed and buy everything they could afford. The Greatest Generation was put on notice to become the first Consumer Generation.', 'This story is what happened to them in between the battle field and building suburbia. Once Donny and Julia meet, it is only a matter of time before she joins the band and brings a set of pipes that is just what the doctor ordered. As a widow, she brings that other side of war. Men prepare for the order of war; women prepare for the disorder. She also brings her own poetry that soon becomes music. The journey to the battle of the bands is on track.', 'Plotwise, this becomes a little too sweet as nothing much de-rails this train. Oh, there is the money that has to be raised. And there is the truth about how Michael died. But through it all there is never a question that this band will succeed and that Donny and Julia are destined to be together.', ""What saves this from death by saccharine is the raw nerves of these veterans. They seem too young to be that wounded, and there are those of us in the audience - we of a certain age - who remember our parents and the Memorial Day parades with the marching veterans. We remember the band music that played in our homes before the invasion of rock and roll. We remember the pictures. The uniforms. The pinned up hair. We remember that we baby boomers were born to a wounded generation who, for the most part, never discussed their war experience. They never had a chance to. They grew up rebounding from WWI, got catapulted into WWII and leapt into the 1950's with no maps to guide them."", 'It is their story that trails after you when you leave the theatre, much like the ghosts belonging to these characters.', 'It is too bad that the authors were not able to take a pair of clippers to the book, and the stunning lack of a resolution doesn\'t help. When the curtain call arrives it catches us off guard, and all we can do is cheer the performers and leave bewildered, wondering what we missed. Not the performances, nor the choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler - which are superb in the extreme. Cott and Osnes positively crackle and the ensemble work is spectacular in every way. But the basics of ""beginning, middle and end"" got left behind at the train depot. And all the big band music in the world doesn\'t quite make up for that.', '(Photo by Jermey Daniel)', '""""Bandstand,"" an openhearted, indecisive new musical, wants you clapping your hands and clenching your fists, tapping your toes and blinking back tears. It is both a peppy celebration of can-do spirit and a more somber exploration of what American servicemen experienced when they marched home from World War II.""', 'Alexis Soloski for New York Times', '""Music soothes the savage beast and — apparently — shell shocked servicemen.

IN THE HEIGHTS,"Review by Barbara Mehlman and Geri Manus', ' 9 May 2008', '""In the Heights,"" which was transported from a little off-Broadway theater to the big time is soaring with its original cast largely in tact, and you can expect to see it win a bunch of Tonys this season. This exhilarating hit musical has made the precarious transition more effortlessly than the gentrification of the neighborhood it portrays.', 'In a perfect blend of ethnic groups, musical genres, and lovable characters, Lin-Manuel Miranda, its creator and star, shows us again what a real modern American musical should be. From the title song¹s opening rap to the strong ballads, to the grand finale, we cheer for the people of this Hispanic immigrant neighborhood because their needs are our needs, their dreams are our dreams, and their life songs are our life songs.', ""The sets, more in proportion to the larger stage, give grander detail to the backdrop of the George Washington Bridge and the apartments above the stores. In addition, the show is 30 minutes longer to accommodate the expansion of three of the roles, and while such a change can sometimes ruin the balance of the original, Miranda's expert rewriting has given greater depth to the story and the characters."", ""The Piragua Guy, selling his brightly colored, sweetly flavored ice was a walk-on in the original, but is now a person with his own story and song; Usnavi, played by Miranda, has a real romance with Vanessa, the beautiful young hairdresser who wants to move downtown; and Carla, the shop's owner, gets to move further uptown to something bigger and better."", 'Still central is the love story between the Stanford University dropout, Nina (Mandy Gonzalez), her boyfriend Benny (Christopher Jackson), and the struggles with Nina\'s parents who run the local livery cab shop.

A Bronx Tale - The Musical,"It is the rare Broadway show that leaves its audience disturbed by gun violence and racial slurs even as they go happily humming doo-wop on their way out of the theater. And indeed it is the rare Broadway show that attempts to portray gangsters as something other than secretly good-hearted slobs. But such is the case with A Bronx Tale, a winningly performed but losing-ly scripted musical based on a movie based on a one-man show based partially on actual events.', ""Playwright and actor Chazz Palminteri gives us the coming of age tale of an Italian-American boy named Calogero (Hudson Loverro when a child, Bobby Conte Thornton when on the cusp of manhood). Young C, as he is called, faces the basic Shakespearean father figure dilemma. His biological dad, Lorenzo (Richard H. Blake) is a good-hearted, bus driving, family man, but the adult he truly admires is Sonny (Nick Cordero), an all-powerful mob kingpin. As he is busy being pulled in both directions, he falls for Jane (Ariana Debose), the right girl with the wrong skin color. Luckily for C, he lives in a musical theater world where no crisis lasts more than a couple minutes. Murders are forgotten about and accusations pivot for no apparent reason. In a less than satisfying conclusion, C's choice of male role model is made for him and he gets the girl, but then ultimately forgets her. And wait, was that a hint that maybe Lorenzo isn't his real father that went flying by? There's also a very confusing moment involving a guy running with a Molotov cocktail, but never mind."", 'This is a production that attempts to serve many masters, and the outcome is more jarring than it is synchronistic. Deadly beatings compete with Sergio Trujillo\'s lively dance numbers. A happy ensemble piece is immediately followed by a guy being shot in the head. Real life outcomes temper Palminteri\'s dramatic urges. Then sometimes, it becomes a classic Alan Menken musical. Set in the same era as Little Shop of Horrors, and about 180 blocks to the north of Mushnik\'s Flower Shop, the melodic parallels run deep. The opening number, ""Belmont Avenue,"" is a close cousin to Little Shop\'s opener, ""Skid Row,"" here with four doo-wop singers instead of three street urchins providing the harmonies. And later, when the towering Sonny sings to the naive Calogero over a raucous game of craps in ""Roll \'Em,"" it might as well be Little Shop\'s monster plant demanding blood from Seymour in ""Feed Me."" Glenn Slater\'s lyrics, though, are often too on the nose. Not only is there the nearly satirical, ""This is a Bronx tale,"" repeatedly intoned throughout, Calogero\'s ruminative song about interracial romance begins flatly, ""In a world like this, where everything seems black and white, in a world like this, they\'re so quick to tell you what\'s wrong and what\'s right.""', ""Fortunately, the cast shines, with Mr. Cordero being the brightest of the stars. Whether crooning, Sinatra-like, in a beautiful baritone, or endowing Sonny with just the right amount of pathos, he effectively steals the show from Mr. Thornton, who sings well but lacks Cordero's stage presence, or Palminteri's stage presence for that matter. The odd couple directing duo of Jerry Zaks and Robert De Niro find many a mobsterly detail to keep the huge ensemble busy. In a cinematic piece of staging that will undoubtedly be stolen when someone decides to write Goodfellas, the Musical, we meet Sonny's crew in a bar with the action pausing as each character poses for a mug shot while Sonny reels off his gangster nickname. It's highly reminiscent of the De Niro film. Meanwhile, Beowulf Boritt's smart scene design is full of towering fire escapes where various characters magically appear and then vanish. It's a fitting visual metaphor for a story about a boy who feels the heat as he tries to find the best way out of his childhood."", '(Photo by Joan Marcus)', '\xa0', '""Sometimes plain old pasta with red sauce is just what the doctor ordered. \'A Bronx Tale\'... might be called the musical-theater equivalent of that classic comfort food.

Ding, ding, ding. Move over Disney, if you can do it, why can\'t Fox?', 'How about the fact that they\'re billing it as an ""original"" musical with a ""new score"" that\'s ""inspired"" by the movies?

But in 2007, it was proved conclusively through DNA testing of remains found, that Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna was murdered along with the rest of her imperial family in Yekaterinburg, Russia by Bolshevik secret police.', 'But the Broadway Anastasia, is a fairy tale, where the beautiful young princess (alright, Grand Duchess but you know all the little girls are going to want to be ""Princess Anastasia""), manages to escape a dreadful fate, but winds up with amnesia.

There was a £10,000,000 account of Tsar Nicholas II at stake in Britain so many were tempted to make the attempt. The most widely known claimant, Anna Anderson, first came to light in Berlin in 1922.

This fishy choreography, however, is mitigated with the ingenious use of heelys, or ""merblades,"" as the production has renamed those sneakers with built-in wheels, to make her mobile. Fits right in with a Disney ride concept, which unfortunately, is the overwhelming subtext of this show.', 'Ariel traverses what appears to be lighted Mylar shower curtains simulating waves and water, not unlike the technique used for the shipwreck in the ill-fated ""Tarzan."" Her colorful, albeit stiff plasticized costume, designed by award-winning designer, Tatiana Noginova, was more entertaining when it was spoofed in ""Forbidden Broadway"" than it is in this $15,000,000 production.', 'But Ariel, like Belle in ""Beauty and the Beast,"" is a truly formidable and appealing female character, one that speaks to budding feminists, and the one redeeming quality of the overblown musical. She rebels against a tyrannical father and insists on making her own decisions. Though her destiny is to be a siren, she finds this role too confining and ventures to the surface, defying family and friends -- not to mention gravity -- in a simulation worthy of another ride through scrims and scenery, and saves the tempest-tossed Prince Eric.', 'To her credit, as taken as she is with him, her goal to live in ""The World Above,"" overrides her romantic desires. These ideas are inspiring for young girls, but the kudos for this wonderful character goes, not to Disney, but to Hans Christian Andersen and the beloved animated film scored by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken.', 'The other actors, unfortunately, are commodities and none has star power, with the obvious exception, of course, of Sherie Rene Scott, who wowed audiences in ""Aida"" and ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.""', 'Scott is a deliciously evil sea witch in all her tentacled glory, and her rendition of ""I Want the Good Times Back"" may become a new standard for belters on Broadway. This character is larger than life, and as Scott herself has admitted, sheï¿½s transformed in this role. But her transformation is more a result of being enmeshed in an enormous costume beset with moving parts than a character driven reaction to events onstage.', 'The clever choreography of the dancers sans legs is also a victim of technology, dwarfed by the specter of the moving set. Dancers are forced to duck and twirl amongst its arms as if running through whirling saucer rides in Disneyland. In the more elaborate production numbers, gimmicks and timing are everything.', 'As actors wheely about, led by Tituss Burgess in the role of Sebastian the Crab (though he looks more like a lobster), the real star of his show-stopping number, ""Under the Sea,"" is the multi-tiered serpentine contraption upon which the actors writhe. Beautifully constructed star-studded clamshells mechanically open and close revealing actors in every would-be pearl producer.', 'You get the idea. ""The Little Mermaid"" is really about fabulous feats of engineering, and a merchandising vehicle for toys, dolls, and eventual theme-park rides. So, if the kids hound you, take them to see the show, take earplugs, and maybe a magazine. Or better yet, put the few hundred dollars you\'ll spend on tickets towards a trip to Disneyworld and make everyone happy.', 'Barbara Mehlman & Geri Manus', 'What the press had to say.....', '""But in a perverse process of devolution ï¿½The Little Mermaidï¿½ arrives on Broadway stripped of the movieï¿½s generation-crossing appeal. Coherence of plot, endearing quirks of character, even the melodious wit of the original score (supplemented by new, substandard songs by Mr. Menken and the lyricist Glenn Slater) have been swallowed by an unfocused spectacle, more parade than narrative, that achieves the dubious miracle of translating an animated cartoon into something that feels like less than two dimensions""', ' ', 'Ben Brantley', ' ', 'New York Times', ' ', ' ""Kids, especially girls and young women who grew up adoring the movie, will be enchanted by all the bright colors and nonstop motion.

Aladdin,"In the UK, there is a Christmas tradition in British theatre called Pantomime. This phenomenon is foreign to American audiences, and is perhaps difficult to sell convincingly, but here goes: A pantomime takes the form of a tongue-in-cheek staging of a popular fairy tale, which encourages as much audience participation as possible. There is always a man dressed up as a ludicrous-looking woman known as the Dame (in the case of 'Aladdin' it's Widow Twanky), often a girl will play the lead male role (such as Peter Pan... Yes, it's all very gender-confusing) and a 'Dr. Evil-style' villain (who is constantly booed out of the building by the children in the audience, whenever he creeps onto the stage). There are also a few filthy jokes thrown into the mix, which fly straight over the childrens' heads and cheekily reward their accompanying parents. In short, the pantomime is a theatrical tradition that is belittled by theatre snobs, but wholeheartedly loved by families and secret 'guilty pleasure-seeking' theatregoers."", ""Although pantomime is relatively unknown in the States, having recently attended a performance of Disney's latest mega-hit 'Aladdin,' I feel it is the closest thing to it in the good ole U S of A. Particularly the performance of Jonathan Freeman as treacherous Jafar (a role he reprises from voicing the character in the original 1992 animated film) reminded me of the old-school pantomime villain. Alas, there was no sign of boisterous booing from the audience..."", ""The musical, whilst perhaps not as creatively imaginative as Disney's standard barer 'The Lion King,' it certainly gets more laughs and the book's wise-cracking one-liners, often Arabian-themed, lend some refreshing, adult satisfaction. Most of these come from the show-stealing performance of James Monroe Iglehart as Genie, whose Tony Award-winning turn is truly a delight to behold. Stepping into the shoes of the late great Robin Williams (surely one of the main reasons, the animated classic was so popular) must be daunting at the least, but Iglehart gives a new and unique life to the character, whilst maintaining Mr Williams' high levels of energy and pace. His tour-de-force number 'Friend Like Me,' simply put, is musical theatre heaven! He is also quite the accomplished dancer and as light on his feet as the rest of the ensemble."", ""Other comic relief comes in the form of Iago (a conniving parrot sidekick in the movie, now embodied as a short and stout human by Don Darryl Rivera), whose hilarious portrayal is a masterclass of comic timing. Three new additions to the cast are Aladdin's three, loyal buddies - Babkak, Omar and Kassim (Brian Gonzales, Jonathan Schwartz and Steel Burkhardt respectively) - who replace cheeky and loveable animated monkey Abu (although he does makes a cameo appearance on a poster in Act II!). These three amigos each have rounded characters and perform their comic sequences with vigour."", ""The costumes and sets are wonderfully bright and make the production the most vibrantly colourful of all Disney Theatrical's offerings to date. Hats off to the ensemble members who undergo several quick (and magnificent) costume changes during the procession within the single musical number of 'Prince Ali'!"", ""Finally, the performances of Adam Jacobs as Aladdin and Courtney Reed as Princess Jasmine, although overshadowed by Iglehart, shine especially during their musical numbers. Particular favourites are the duet 'A Million Miles Away' and Aladdin's recurring solo 'Proud of Your Boy,' which both add some much needed character depth and showcase each actors' beautiful vocals. And of course, who can resist being swept along by the extremely impressive magic carpet scene during 'A Whole New World'?"", 'As I left the stunning New Amsterdam Theatre, I heard a child asking her mother: ""How do they make that carpet fly, Mummy?"" Her simple reply: ""That\'s Disney magic!""

Disgraced,"Disgraced. I have been thinking about this word ever since I saw this play.

She is as white as white can get, a painter with a liberal view point who has recently become enamored of Islamic traditions, culture and art work. This is a thin-ice area as Amir has put distance between himself and the prejudices of Islam. He thinks."", ""When his nephew Abe - formerly Hussein Malik - (Danny Ashok) asks him to look into the trial of an imam accused of collecting money to give to Hamas, Amir refuses.

Her mind apparently is on an interview with a friend, Isaac (Josh Radnor) who is a Whitney curator interested in her work. Isaac arrives, Amir leaves, and Emily gives Isaac, and us, a verbal essay on the value of Islamic culture. That comes across like a PBS series: The Muslims gave us Aristotle.

We wouldn't even have visual perspective."", ""Isaac instantly becomes an admirer of her work although the painting hanging on the wall is tepid at best.

What follows is a not so believable descent into a mudwrestling mess that pits race, culture, religion and sex against each other and then lights a match. Once again we get more education on the Quran, which is not such a bad idea, but coming from the mouth of a man who has renounced his religion, it is odd.

As the new country is formed, he stays in the inner circle, annoying Thomas Jefferson (Daveed Diggs) who was in France for most of the war, and drives Burr just a little mad.

The rules of dueling are spelled out more than one time. The future is seen as a place where these folks may not walk but in which they will be remembered.

So it was with some trepidation that I saw this show. Even though everyone has been raving about it, I was still cautious.', 'The good news is that this production bowls you over. You don\'t have a chance to not like it because it, like the Mormons it depicts, is positive that something good will happen if you just hang around for awhile. And the message is that, in the words of Dr. Seuss, ""We are all a little weird, and life\'s a little weird, and when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall in mutual weirdness and call it love.""', ""Two little Mormon missionaries - are they all white men? - are paired up together and sent to Uganda. Elder Price (Andrew Rannells), who could be the Ken to anyone's Barbie, was hoping for Orlando. Elder Cunningham (Josh Gad) is a sad sack grateful to be chosen for anything at all. Disappointment and enthusiasm are thus bound together and shipped east, way east."", 'Upon their arrival they meet villagers who are suffering from AIDS, drought, disease, and dictators. The villagers teach the two missionaries their favorite uplifting song, ""Hasa Diga Eebowai."" As life batters them in the head over and over again, it is this song that keeps them going. Price and Cunningham join in with that old-fashioned Mormon enthusiasm, only to find out that this song means, ""F--k you, God."" Welcome to the world, boys.', 'At missionary HQ they meet a randy bunch of also white boys led by Elder McKinley (Rory O\'Malley) who have nothing to show for their time in Uganda - no Baptisms, no nothin\'. But they do have one thing: their own musical theme song to aid them in times of question and doubt. ""Turn It Off"" - as in, turn off anything that means questioning the Mormon path: thoughts of homosexuality, memories of abuse, guilt of any kind. Welcome to another world, boys.', ""What follows is a love story where Price and Cunningham have to find their own paths without the other's help. Price tries to flee his fate while Cunningham deals fast and loose with his proselytizing. On the other side of the story, the villagers are caught between swallowing the Book of Mormon (the Third Testament of the Bible) as told by Cunningham, and making it through another day without being killed or having a clitoridectomy."", ""As a matter of fact, the clitoris is a focal point of this story and is mentioned, oh, about 30 times as a point of focus in Uganda. Here girls are raped and then circumcised (read: genital mutilation) to keep them from getting any ideas or pleasure for the rest of their lives. This subject is bandied about like a beach ball throughout the show along with child rape, frog rape, AIDS, maggot infestation, Spooky Mormon Hell, and Jesus. It is mentioned just enough to get people's attention, but I hope not so much that it will be dismissed as incidental or worse, a myth."", 'In the end everyone here is gullible and worthy of a dope-slap. From the Mormons to General Butt F--king Naked (Brian Tyree Henry) to the young woman Nabulungi (Nikki M. James), whose name Cunningham never gets right in a running joke that somehow works every time. The Mormons will figure out an answer to any argument. The General would rather kill than argue and wants everything and everyone to belong — to him. Nabulungi — kind of like the Little Mermaid — wants to get out of Dodge and go to Salt Lake City (""Sal Tlay Ka Siti""). Like the rest of us, the gal just wants to belong, period.', ""Ain't no one or nothing safe in "", 'The Book of Mormon', "", least of all the audience. This show makes you realize that when you are pointing one finger to make fun of someone, there are three fingers pointed back at you. And this news is delivered with a smile — a real one.

Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"There are true stories of people who have not only forgiven the person who murdered their child/parent/fellow parishioner, but meet with the perpetrator, visit, write, and even testify to have that person freed from prison and maintain an ongoing relationship.', 'At the other end of the spectrum is Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Sent away to prison for life on trumped up charges by a Judge who wanted to seduce Sweeney’s beautiful wife, Sweeney is hell-bent on revenge.', 'Somewhere in between those two extremes are most of the rest of us. Surely we have been wronged in our lives, sometimes grievously, sometimes seemingly unforgivably. Perhaps we have been the victim of violence, dishonest business partners, lied about in divorce or custody battles, or had our heart wounded by a life-long cumulative toxic build-up of injustices.', 'To those who live in a moral limbo — not wishing to add any further pain to the universe through a vengeful response, but not being able to fully forgive, time may prove to be a salve. Love, true to cliche, may heal as well. And then there is art — art such as this current production of Stephen Sondheim’s musical masterpiece. Extraordinary art. Art that uses tragedy, humor, music & lyrics to remind us of the cost of hell-bent revenge, no matter how justified it may be.', ""But you needn't have a past of pain nor require a palliative prescription to see a superb production of a classic musical. Sweeney Todd is flawless theater. Eight amazing performers, led by a brooding, I-have-but-one-thought-in-my-mind Norm Lewis as Sweeney Todd, and Carolee Carmello as a cheerily good-natured psychopath side-kick Mrs. Lovett."", 'The set is “immersive.” Since much of Sweeney Todd occurs in a London pie shop with a barber shop above, the Barrow Street Theater has been turned into a pie shop. The actors move all about the space and interact with you, sometimes singing inches away from your seat.', 'Even though Sweeney Todd is not an improv show, this intense cast-audience connection reminded me of the brilliant improv troupe Chicago City Limits (NYC based, the name confusingly referring to their point of origin) in their heyday of the 1980’s and 90’s. In that show the boundary between stage edge and seating meant nothing; actors and audience rejoiced in a deeply shared experience. There will likely always be a place for the proscenium stage, but productions like these show us how utterly engaging more creatively intimate theater can be.', 'Bravo to Barrow Street for this tour de force, bravo to director Bill Buckhurst, and bravo to the entire cast and production team. Bravo is what I and many others shouted as part of a standing ovation at the end.', 'It should be noted that the bloodshed that is integral to the story is not graphic, but this show may still be too intense a subject for children or theatergoers who who prefer to see lighter fare. For everyone else, Sweeney Todd is as good as a musical gets, as good as theater gets, and a great reminder that, no matter how tempting, meeting injustice with wanton revenge will rarely give lasting satisfaction.

From the crackle of his hi-fi, the musical magically bursts to life on stage, telling the tale of a pampered Broadway starlet who wants to give up show business to get married, her producer who sets out to sabotage the nuptials, her chaperone, the debonair groom, the dizzy chorine, the Latin lover and a pair of gangsters who double as pastry chefs."", '\xa0', '\xa0', 'The consensus of critics seems to be that The Drowsy Chaperone, the fluffy new musical which recently opened at the Marquis Theater, is major competition for the current (and my) fave, Jersey Boys, for this yearï¿½s Tony award for Best New Musical. I beg to differ.', 'Send-ups of musical conventions like this show are not unknown to New York audiences. The annual productions of Forbidden Broadway have been doing it brilliantly for years. What is new (?) about The Drowsy Chaperone is that it is a send-up of the conventions of musicals of 80 years ago, with a few current issues (like the scourge of cell phones) thrown in for good measure.', 'Such subjects may be entertaining for folks who have never seen revivals of the numerous old shows that have been semi-staged at the City Centerï¿½s Encores series or fully-staged at nearby theaters like the Paper Mill Playhouse or Goodspeed. My impression on the night I saw it was that the audience at The Drowsy Chaperone was just bathing in the familiarity of it all. This is not what makes Tony Best Musical material or a positive commentary on the future of this American art form.', 'The music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison are neither memorable nor especially witty. The title of the showï¿½s major anthem, ï¿½As We Stumble Along,ï¿½ seems particularly apt. The direction by Casey Nicholow is professional but predictable.', 'Which is not to say that the production hasnï¿½t got its plusses. Bob Martin, who stars as the narrator in a moldy old cardigan, has wonderful comic timing and holds the whole evening together with his warmth and charm. Heï¿½s also co-author of the book with Don McKellar and, in that role, I would give him lesser marks.', 'I canï¿½t give many kudos to the rest of the cast because every one of them is made to play a cartoon-like type and spends 100% of the evening merely going through the appropriate motions. For example, Georgia Engel as a ditz is not an original idea. Ditto for Beth Leavel as the title character, a siren with a heart. Troy Britton Johnson is slickly good-looking in the role of the romantic lead but only moderately good on roller-skates in a limited space. And we donï¿½t get to see nearly enough of the star (and she is one), Sutton Foster. Her main contribution is to reveal some previously unknown gymnastic ability and to prance through a big star turn uttering just-plain-stupid lyrics about monkeys.', 'The set by David Gallo, in which all scenes take place inside the frame of the narratorï¿½s run-down gated-window pad, is particularly clever.

So how has this iconic musical managed to outlast its competitors in the increasingly crowded and competitive market place that is Broadway?', 'One word can sum it all up, really… “Class”… which just so happens to be the title of one of the more reflective numbers in the show. As Velma and Mama Morton were serenading us, asking whatever happened to class, I couldn’t help but think that this production has it in abundance. Chicago proves that you don’t need to bombard your audience with a number of lavish sets or elaborate costume changes to put together a winning musical. All you need is a live band on stage, intoxicating the auditorium with that jazz-infused score from the genius that is John Kander and Fred Ebb and sprinkle it with that Bob Fosse-style choreography, and before you know it, you’ve razzle dazzled ‘em! Those tight-fitting, all-black (and often transparent) costumes by William Ivey Long enhance the show’s sensuality with equal measures of male and female exposure and have themselves become as recognisable as the show’s glittering red logo.', 'You forget how ground-breaking this revival must have been, when it officially opened on Broadway on 14th November 1996.

Some of the company’s principals have been with the show for quite some time and continue to delight with every performance. NaTasha Yvette Williams’ brassy and sultry Mama Morton, Raymond Bokhour’s ever-loveable Amos and R.
