In an attempt to blend my background in theater with tech and machine learning, I wanted to explore how Broadway shows become what they are - are any trends on what makes a popular show? How much do reviews actually affect a show's performance? What are the leading genres of shows, and are there any genres that tend to suffer the most? It was this curiosity that led me to come up with this project idea. Here I was able to gain new skills in web scraping, wrangle data that I had gathered, and then test the waters with some NLP before diving in for a more proper analysis.
