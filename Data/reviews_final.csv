'Melissa Etheridge: My Window' review — a celebration of the singer's truest self,"Read our review of ', 'My Window', "", Grammy Award winner Melissa Etheridge's theatrical concert, playing at the Circle in the Square Theatre through November 19."", ""Melissa Etheridge is a Grammy- and Oscar-winning, globally successful rock star who, thanks to a folksy heartland sound and gritty, gravelly voice that sets her apart from her rock peers, still has the vibe of a hidden-gem indie artist. It's a contradiction she seems to be aware of and one that makes her theatrical concert, "", 'Melissa Etheridge: My Window', ', work.', 'No indie small-timer, of course, would get a two-month solo stint in a Broadway theatre to essentially narrate their Wikipedia biography and sing songs they assume many ticketholders will know the words to. But unlike ', 'Bruce Springsteen', ""'s 2017 Broadway concert (which inspired Etheridge's) at the cavernous "", 'St. James Theatre', "", Etheridge's gets the "", 'Circle in the Square', ', which is closer to a Brooklyn music hall than an arena. The singer even walks among the audience while flawlessly shredding on the guitar.', ""The venue admittedly does most of the heavy lifting in bringing audiences closer to Etheridge than ever before. Much of the information she shares about herself in the show's 2.5 hours — her upbringing in Kansas, lesbian-bar-singer-to-star arc, interest in alternative medicine, romantic relationships, personal tragedies — is readily available online. And in her attempt to hit all the major points in her 62 years of life, she and director Amy Tinkham speed through much of it. But fans will nonetheless enjoy hearing Etheridge's story from her own lips, and when she slows down and lets us — and herself — live in a moment and feel a feeling for a little while, "", 'My Window', ' is completely riveting.', 'Etheridge's memory of her first kiss is a highlight — with a fellow church girl with ""eyes of green with a brown streak like rust."" It's an innocent and tender excavation, not just a remembrance, of her wide-eyed teenage self. It's one of many romantic dalliances she recalls during ', 'My Window', "", which grow increasingly punchier, cheekier, and increasingly captivating if only because an older lesbian professing her truth and sexuality on stage is still something so rare. Another contradiction, considering that Etheridge reminds us her coming out in 1993 didn't derail her career — a statement that almost proves surprising (and educational) in 2023."", ""Her segments on the benefits of drugs and alternative medicine are, though also not rushed, less effective, as she takes a preachy rather than introspective tone. But luckily, no matter how overlong any bit of narration gets, Etheridge's next song saves the day."", 'From her best-known hits to the first song she ever wrote as a kid, each one soars, their poetic lyrics supplying the emotional depth the script sometimes misses. As a casual Etheridge fan, I left wanting to listen to each song over again and discover the rest, though the exhilarating experience of hearing her pour her desperation into ""I'm the Only One,"" her fiery desire into ""I Wanna Come Over,"" and the full extent of her nimble guitar mastery into ""Bring Me Some Water"" live is something the recordings can't replicate.

'Alex Edelman: Just For Us' review — solo show is better and funnier than ever on Broadway,"Read our five-star review of ', 'Just For Us', ' on Broadway, the solo comedy show running at the Hudson Theatre through August 19 after multiple Off-Broadway runs.', 'Did you hear the one about the Orthodox Jewish standup comedian who crashes a meeting of white supremacists and turns the incident into the nucleus of his one-man show that’s now on Broadway?', 'That’s the two-second backstory of Alex Edelman’s tangy, topical, and, best of all, laugh-out-loud solo work, ', 'Just for Us', '. It’s that rare theatrical production that doesn’t just live up to the hype — it exceeds it.', 'After extending numerous times ', 'off Broadway last year', ', the roughly 75-minute piece is now at the ', 'Hudson Theatre', '. Just like for the venue’s former resident, ', 'A Doll’s House', ', the stage is bare. But the turntable used for that play is gone.', 'Edelman does the all spinning here as he displays his irresistible gift for storytelling, comedy, and capturing theatregoers’ undivided attention. This was my introduction to the show. Count me in as an instant admirer.', 'Edelman’s narrative approach recalls the comedian Mike Birbiglia, a producer here. Edelman shuns a straight line. He takes detours, roundabouts, cloverleafs, you name it. Still, his story feels seamless. Adam Brace, who died earlier this year, is credited as director. Alex Timbers is a creative consultant.', 'Edelman’s shirt, paired with plain pants and white sneakers, is fastened to the tippy top. But there’s nothing buttoned-up about him. He’s rarely still. He’s kinetic, crossing from one side of the stage to the other. He’s constantly raking his hand through his hair.', 'Comedy is about timing. He doesn’t rush to get to the main event in his story – that anti-Semitic meetup. Instead he begins with a seemingly arbitrary anecdote involving Robin Williams and a gorilla that learned American Sign Language. The point? The late celebrity’s comedy was so momentous it crossed “the species barrier.”', 'Edelman, meanwhile, claims his brand of humor is “so dumb and small.” It isn’t. At all. But it is very personal. It’s about his Jewishness, about his whiteness, about his family.', 'There’s a bit about his brother becoming a winter Olympian in the sport of skeleton, which he describes as combining an icy hill and a lunch tray. He recalls how his devout Jewish family celebrated Christmas for the sake of his mom’s friend. There’s a reference to growing up “in this really racist part of Boston called Boston.” Anti-vax friends also get their moment. As he mines and massages his life into funny business, it hits me: He’s ""The Marvelous Mr. Edelman.""', 'He eventually settles into how he responded to an online invitation to attend a meetup in New York City for folks questioning their whiteness. Turns out, no surprise, he was the lone Jewish person in the room.', ""Arriving at the Queens apartment where it was held, things seem benign enough. There are pastries and juice. There’s a woman working a massive jigsaw puzzle, an activity rich in metaphor as Edelman pieces together his show. It’s all fun and games – until the attendees recognize someone who doesn't belong."", 'Edelman, a fish out of water, flirts with a girl who he knows is a bigot. He listens as talk turns to mixed-race Meghan Markle marrying into the royal family. He clenches when someone mentions that “Jews are sneaky and they’re everywhere.”', 'He admits he feels empathy – right up to the point where he’s outed for being Jewish and is asked to leave. This meeting, he’s told, is ""just for us."" Maybe Edelman thought others in the room would just see Alex, not Jewish Alex. But he couldn’t cross the species barrier.', 'Nonetheless, Edelman leaves the get-together richer.

Unwittingly becoming one of humanity’s first time travelers and nearly wiping out your own existence by meddling in your parents’ meet-cute is, to quote Doc, “some serious shit.”', ""That's a lot for one teenager like Marty to handle — not to mention the ultimate terror of capturing his unknowing high-school-aged mother’s affections. And yet, "", 'Back to the Future', ' emerges, and continues to be regarded, as a funny, cult-classic romp. The musical adaptation, now on Broadway with 1.21 gigawatts of spectacle, honors all these views at once and gives ', 'Back to the Future', ' the larger-than-life presentation it deserves.', 'The design, naturally, does a lot of the heavy lifting. Walking into the ', 'Winter Garden Theatre', ' feels like walking into a ', 'Back to the Future', "" augmented-reality theme park attraction: A network of LEDs outfits the proscenium, the railings of the box seats, and even the ceiling. The design feels immersive, aided by Finn Ross's videos that, at one point, even put audiences into Marty's point of view as he rockets from 1985 to 1955."", ""That's not to mention the rest of Hatley's meticulously detailed sets and vibrant period costumes, Tim Lutkin and Hugh Vanstone's hyperactive lighting (which, along with smoke effects, aid Chris Fisher's sci-fi illusions), and Gareth Owen's heart-thumping sound. Together with director John Rando's staging and Chris Bailey's athletic choreography that works the large ensemble for all it's got, the whole production is clearly eager, desperate even, to thrill you at every second. But to again quote Doc (and the title of his triumphant entrance song), it works."", 'On the topic of the songs, those mostly work, including timeless film favorites like ""The Power of Love"" and ""Johnny B. Goode."" A third of the score could have otherwise been cut. Some are repetitive — not every song needs a reprise, and not every character needs a full-length ""I want"" number (or multiple) where a line or two of dialogue would suffice. It feels like a retroactive attempt to invest audiences in the characters, who get rather abruptly introduced at the start.', ""It's an odd paradox, that "", 'Back to the Future', "" assumes prior familiarity with the film such that the players need little introduction, while positing nearly every character as worthy of substantial exploration. Chalk it up, perhaps, to the fact that two of the movie's creators are involved: Bob Gale adapted the musical's book from his and Robert Zemeckis's screenplay, and Alan Silvestri, who composed the film score, co-wrote the musical's rollicking score with Glen Ballard. They clearly know and adore all their characters, but not all audiences have the same depth of understanding, especially 38 years on from the film's premiere."", ""But like the DeLorean climbing to the crucial 88 miles per hour, the writers ultimately succeed in building the show's momentum and narrative heft. Once Marty meets his teenaged parents, Lorraine and George, in 1955 and catches Lorraine's eye before George can, he has to course-correct — and gets to know his parents better in the process.

But Christopher Lloyd made the character so indelible on screen that to forget Doc would be a crime. And from his first entrance in a cloud of smoke, Roger Bart, also reprising his role from London, makes the character iconic anew.', 'Bart milks Doc's triumphant early songs for all they're worth, complete with a leggy ensemble as backup — which only make his poignant Act 2 ballad, ""For the Dreamers,"" strike the heartstrings even more. It's then we learn that, before Marty proved otherwise, Doc spent 30 years worrying he'd fail — and be forgotten in time.', '""This one's for the dreamers who were close, but no cigar,"" Doc laments, Bart utterly sincere.

The sly implications of that decor eventually become clear. It’s always been a place about notching trophies.', 'It’s the morning after “passionate, wildly erotic sex.” Beau’s showering. Sylvia wears lingerie and is lit by afterglow. Per usual, he calls her Tulip, an endearment that makes her weak in the knees. But something’s different. Sylvia’s got a seven-year itch. She wants Beau to herself full-time. She has sent a telegram to her husband, Clarke (Alex Moffat, of ', 'Saturday Night Live', '), and Beau’s wife, Marjorie (Lilli Cooper), to tell them what’s going on.', ""In short order, they come to the love shack. The place gets even more crowded with the arrival of Deirdre (Dana Steingold) and her ex-husband Richard (Nehal Joshi). To reveal more about their interconnections and plot twists would be a killjoy. Suffice it to say there's a daisy chain of dalliances – and one link is way too close for comfort."", ""Of course, that’s the point. For laughs' sake, the situation is over-the-top.

Suffice it to say the play speaks directly to today’s racial tumult.', 'Considering Ossie Davis’s satirical melodrama premiered on Broadway in 1961, that says something about the stubbornly enduring bigotry and prejudice this broad satire has squarely in its crosshairs. Without saying the actual contemporary phrase, Davis, a writer, actor, director, and civil rights activist, declared to audiences 62 years ago in this work that Black lives matter.', 'Subtitled ', 'A Non-Confederate Romp Through the Cotton Patch', ', the play unfolds in the late 1950s. Self-made traveling minister Purlie Victorious Judson (Odom) returns to segregated small-town Georgia with a plan to buy and rehab the broken-down local church, Big Bethel, and “preach freedom in the cotton patch.” But first, he must trick Ol Cap’n Cotchipee (Jay O. Sanders) – a whip-lashing Jim Crow tyrant who believes in “all that is white and holy” – into handing over $500 that was bequeathed to Purlie’s family.', 'Key to Purlie’s plan is his besotted follower from Alabama, Lutiebelle Gussie Mae Jenkins (Young). She pretends to be his Cousin Bee, who’s in line for the inheritance. Reluctantly drawn into the ruse is Purlie’s brother, Gitlow (Billy Eugene Jones), whose adherence to the old plantation ways leads Cotchipee to cheer him as a “solid, hard-earned Uncle Tom.” Purlie’s sister-in-law Missy (an ace Heather Alicia Simms), who shares the dream of breathing life back into Big Bethel, lends her own source of support.', 'Lutiebelle is game for anything to help, but she’s unprepared to pull off the high-stakes impersonation, so the Bee sting eventually – and riotously – goes pear-shaped at the plantation.', 'But Purlie persists. He finds an ally in Cotchipee’s liberal-minded son Charlie (Noah Robbins), who supports court decisions to void segregation. After his mother died in childbirth, Charlie was raised by Idella (Vanessa Bell Calloway), and he believes in the rights of African Americans. That comes in handy.', 'Zipping along in a fleet-footed 100 streaming minutes, the staging by Kenny Leon (', 'Topdog/Underdog, Ohio State Murders', ') boasts terrific work across the board.

"'Good Night, Oscar' review — Sean Hayes delivers a virtuosic character study","Read our review of ', 'Good Night, Oscar', ', a new Broadway play written by Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize winner Doug Wright and starring Emmy Award winner Sean Hayes.', 'The star of Douglas Wright’s play ', 'Good Night, Oscar', ', now running on Broadway at the ', 'Belasco Theatre', ', is ', 'Sean Hayes', ', who receives above-the-title billing and will no doubt receive numerous accolades. But the second star is Jacqueline E. Lawton, the production’s dramaturg on Broadway and at the Goodman Theatre, where it premiered last year. Lawton ensures that the show balances its dips into the fantastical with historical truths, a difficult tone deftly achieved in Lisa Peterson’s adroit production. If only Broadway would embrace the lobby display to immerse audiences even more in Oscar Levant’s world.', 'Set on one turbulent night of Levant’s life, ', 'Good Night, Oscar', ' sees Hayes not at the heyday of Levant’s career as a composer, pianist, and radio star, but as an ailing man struggling to control his addiction to the drugs his doctors have prescribed. The play tries to tackle the whole of Levant’s life in a few short scenes; a one-man show, like Wright’s Tony- and Pulitzer Prize-winning ', 'I Am My Own Wife', ', may have better suited the veneration of Levant’s talents and idiosyncrasies, channeling his alleged schizophrenia into different characters contained in one body.', 'But Hayes works best sparring with other actors, even if their characters aren’t fully developed. At one point, NBC president Bob Sarnoff (Peter Grosz) tries to cool Levant down: “The network feels —” to which Levant immediately interrupts, in a perfect distillation of the contemporary politics of corporate brands, “The network ', 'feels', '?”', 'Many characters exist only as devices: Fast-talking TV host Jack Paar (Ben Rappaport) upholds the play’s frame of ', 'The Tonight Show', ' and delineates entertainment and exploitation. June (Emily Bergl), Levant’s wife, though granted no interiority, grounds the piece in historicity, as she had Levant committed to psychiatric institutions multiple times over their marriage. Sarnoff is stiff and corny, mostly speaking in platitudes and warnings and dwarfed by Levant’s boisterousness.', 'Alvin Finney (Marchánt Davis), an orderly from the hospital where Levant is staying (and from which June has concocted an ill-advised escape so he may appear on TV), serves only as a reminder of Levant’s condition; his note that Levant’s old pal George Gershwin (John Zdrojeski) stole musical inspiration from Black New Yorkers is a too-brief insight that, absent any other political or social commentary, feels out of place in the script. Only Alex Wyse delights as the nervous Max Weinbaum, a nepotism-hire page desperate to win the approval of those in charge and move up the movie-making ladder.', ""Gershwin himself appears as a figment of Levant’s imagination, the boldest choice in the play that suffers from a lack of direction.

'The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window' review — Lorraine Hansberry's play holds a mirror to the world,"Read our review of Oscar Isaac and Rachel Brosnahan in ', ""The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window"", ' on Broadway, playing at the James Earl Jones Theatre through July 2.', 'The Broadway production of ', 'The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window', ', now running at the ', 'James Earl Jones Theatre', ', feels almost antithetical to the play’s debates about the morality and function of art: Two TV and movie stars (', 'Oscar Isaac', ' in the title role and ', 'Rachel Brosnahan', ' as his wife, Iris) make it a hot ticket, while producers transferred the production from the Brooklyn Academy of Music at the last minute to earn Tony Award nominations. (It earned two, including Best Revival of a Play.)', 'Lorraine Hansberry’s lengthy play was written before the attention span of the theatregoer was influenced by other media, but the length is no obstacle: If conversations run in circles in the Brustein apartment, it’s because real-world conversations of the personal and political sometimes run in circles. If the characters frustrate each other and the audience through self-sabotage, Hansberry lingers in this discomfort without progress on purpose.', 'Sidney Brustein — no longer an idealist but still a fighter, no longer a revolutionary but still moved by the plight of the common man — is not the sort of protagonist who speaks to move the plot forward. He doesn’t force revelations to the surface, but lets them arise naturally. He’s like a less suicidal Hamlet (another famed Isaac performance), shooting himself in the foot each time someone hands him a gun.', 'Sidney is annoying and self-righteous and insistent he doesn’t harbor the prejudices he so clearly carries (especially towards women, including Iris). Hansberry is not interested in placating the audience or in guiding them to a pre-determined conclusion with Sidney as surrogate — she just hands you the map. You have to decide if you’re going to get there, and how.', 'The beauty of Hansberry’s play almost makes up for Anne Kauffman’s production, which feels too unsure of itself to linger or make demands. Both Brosnahan and Isaac emit one-note performances that start high and strong but gradually deflate. Isaac, who is onstage almost the whole show, is at times charming and at times funny, but does not differentiate his performance enough through the first two acts. It is only in the third act’s devastation that Isaac finds something worth holding onto.', 'This third act brings both a foray into the surreal and the appearance of Gus Birney as Gloria, Iris’s younger sister who is hoping to marry Alton (Julian De Niro) and abandon her life as an escort. Birney’s wispy voice is perfect for the ethereal Gloria, whose presence may be an illusion in Kauffman’s more confident third act. Though the characters cavort on pills and find time slowing down, this portion of the play feels the most grounded.', 'Throughout, Iris and her sister Mavis (the hilarious Miriam Silverman, now a Tony nominee) have made all their choices based on Gloria’s, even if they don’t realize it. Gloria’s life as a sex worker, her drug use, and her depression bring the play into reality: Gone are the morality debates. What’s left is materiality, cold and sharp.', 'It is all the more disappointing, then, that the play’s first foray into the surreal, as Iris and Sidney play make-believe, falters. The scene is one of the only moments in which characters use the fire escape and balcony from Santiago Orjuela-Laverde, Andrew Moerdyk, and Kimie Nishikawa (the scenic design collective dots). The Brusteins’s playwright neighbor, David Ragin (Glenn Fitzgerald), often writes at his desk atop the main apartment like a guard in a watchtower. Kauffman gives him little else to do to show he is monitoring the Brusteins.', 'But maybe the Brusteins just aren’t as interesting as they think they are. Maybe this is the point. When she hears of David’s type of drama, Mavis bemoans that there aren’t more plays about ordinary people with ordinary problems. Despite Sidney’s more optimistic friends trudging up his dormant delusions of grandeur, ', 'The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window', ' is essentially that kind of play (though without the straight-edged naturalism the apartment dwellers deride).', 'Sidney and Iris’s dreams and disagreements are quotidian and their tragedies all too common, but this relatability does not diminish them or the text. It folds them into the body politic they debate and resist; it is the regular, normal people of Hansberry’s world who will have the chance to change it. Or perhaps they won’t. Perhaps advocating anything is, as Hansberry posits, imposing totalitarianism on the rest of us.', 'The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window', ' is at the James Earl Jones Theatre through July 2.

Suffice it to say the house is a magnet for men with pasts, women with maternal instincts, and lost girls.', '“I’ve seen this movie,” Henry tells Max as he hobbles around the house where clutter rules and the phone cord is severed. “We don’t make it.” Is his quip black humor?

Francine Evans (Anna Uzele), a singer from Philly fresh off a USO tour, knows she will have to “work twice as hard to get half as far” in a segregated society.', 'Her love interest, Jimmy Doyle (a miscast Colton Ryan), believes Francine’s talent will override racial barriers. This idea comes up various times, expressed by white characters and characters of color, with the general conclusion that New York is special and different, a place with no discrimination.', 'Jimmy rebuffs Francine’s concerns over an interracial musical act with “This isn’t Texas. This is New York!” (The audience cheered.) Toward the end, Francine makes a career decision based on the racism and misogyny she’s experienced, and the characters take this as an offense against New York itself. “Don’t bet against New York,” one implores, as if her actions could possibly be construed that way.', 'Uzele’s Francine is the only character with a plot, and Uzele is the strongest performer. She carries the show as the self-sabotaging Jimmy grows to resent her success and recognition, leaving us without a reason to root for him. Her searing rendition of “But the World Goes Round” alone — during which projection designers Beowulf Boritt and Christopher Ash strip away the photorealistic backgrounds and leave Francine to bare her soul in a stark spotlight — outshines Ryan. His muffled voice doesn’t suit the broad and brassy Kander and Ebb numbers.', 'Ryan is done no favors, of course, by his character’s lack of plot or motive beyond landing Francine. We know he’s haunted by his past, but that doesn’t explain why he ambles about aimlessly until trumpet-playing veteran Jesse (John Clay III) and Cuban immigrant Mateo (Angela Sigala) hand him a second-act raison d’être. Characters in search of a plot, indeed.', 'Haranguing the show feels almost dirty, however, with Ebb long deceased and Kander now 96. (Lin-Manuel Miranda contributed additional lyrics, though his signature style is absent.)

In it, Tessa, a British barrister known for defending men accused of sexual assault, gets date raped herself. The parallels are plain.', 'Suzie Miller’s play offers a reckoning with the before and after. Only in the wake of her assault does Tessa fully wrap her brain around a terrible inequity. The symbol for justice is a woman, and in rape cases, her scales tip toward men. Unfortunately, that’s not exactly headline news.', 'Running 100 unbroken minutes, the production is Exhibit A of how a focused and fierce performance can elevate a work. Comer’s breathless star turn in her Broadway debut does that. Comer, who speaks for several minor characters, has won various awards for her portrait, including an ', 'Olivier', '. She is riveting, even in a late section where Tessa spouts statistics and the play teeters into movie-of-the-week territory.', 'Director Justin Martin keeps Tessa in near-nonstop motion on Miriam Buether’s set lined with soaring floor-to-ceiling case files. Tessa periodically climbs atop a heavy wooden table to make a point. It’s a stagy trick, but it gets attention.', 'Like Tessa, the production is alive. There’s a subtle heartbeat-like throb underscoring the action, incidental music, and bright flashes punctuating scenes thanks to sound designers Ben and Max Ringham, composer Rebecca Lucy Taylor, and lighting designer Natasha Chivers, respectively.', 'When we meet Tessa, she’s in court and at the top of her game. All smirks and smug self-satisfaction, she’s a shameless showboater in a robe and horsehair wig. She gleefully likens taking down a witness to a fight to the death. Armed with her legal cunning and killer instinct, she fires off questions that are aimed to slay, not just wound — bang-bang-bang! She shapes her fingers into a pistol as she revels.', 'When it comes to blasting holes in the testimony of an anguished woman alleging sexual assault, she is just as merciless. Tessa says she is in the business of legal truth — what’s provable beyond a doubt. It’s easy to connect the dots between Tessa and Villanelle, the ', 'Killing Eve', ' assassin that made Comer a star — and accounts for raucous entrance applause.', 'Tessa is in her element in court, but she’s far less so when she’s back home in hardscrabble Liverpool. A brief, fitful visit with her mother and brothers shows she’s left this world behind. Since landing a spot in law school at Cambridge, she’s moved on.', 'In London, she’s a star on the rise, whether in court drag or a flirty green dress for a date with Julian, a colleague she shags on a sofa at work. A week later, after drinks and sex earlier in the evening, Julian rapes Tessa in her home. The details spill out of her in a harrowing torrent echoed by an onstage rainstorm.', 'Tessa knows the law. Her case is iffy, but she decides to press charges. Some 782 days later, she has her day in court, where she knows she’ll be subjected to the same kind of attack she uses against witnesses.

They’re a joy to watch in action – or, well, sitting.

Diana (Linney) sports a black tee and pants, stylish loafers, and a strict curling-ironed coif. Alice (Hecht) is slightly slouchier and sports a patterned peasant dress, suede boots, and a loose, laid-back hairstyle.', 'Over the course of 100 intermissionless minutes, they flash back to America’s bicentennial – a time of independence and, it turns out, interdependence. Diana, an uptight single mom, made and taught art then. Alice, a free-spirited housewife, was married with a daughter. The women met through their kids. During a few months, their initial chilly mutual dislike melted into a warm and solid friendship.', 'Save for a surprise here and there, it’s pretty straightforward stuff. This show is all talk – but the women rarely speak to each other thanks to Auburn’s story structure. Diana and Alice recall their brief history in direct addresses to the audience. It’s as if they’re giving reality show testimonials. The nagging questions: Who are they supposed to be talking to, and why are these two telling this story now? We never really know.', ""The construction can’t help but have a distancing effect. But on the plus side, Auburn packs his script with humor, vivid and lived-in details, and lines that sometimes nail the way people talk. That includes Diana's tangy observation about Alice: “She just thought she was unconventional because her house was messy.”"", 'Over the summer, the bond between the women sneaks up on them amid ups and downs, laughs and arguments. They’re tugged closer together by everyday things like childcare and the subject of art, plus a major twist in Alice’s marriage to Doug, an Ohio State professor. When Doug comes into the picture, Diana speaks on his behalf.', 'Like summertime and lemonade, the two actresses are a great pair. Linney radiates smarts and her no-nonsense frankness is an ideal fit for Diana. Hecht, who never gives an ordinary stage performance, makes Alice likable and quirky.', 'Sullivan gives the actresses room to do what they do best while injecting an occasional direction to “stand up” and “sit back down.” Costumes by Linda Cho define characters, lighting Japhy Weideman suggests shifts in time, and an abstract backdrop of miniature squares by John Lee Beatty seems to seize inspiration from artist Paul Klee, who figures prominently in the story.', 'In the end, Diana and Alice reunite by chance at a New York museum decades after their initial meeting.

So they set out to change that, armed only with a book from the '60s, pop hits from the '90-00s, and each other's support. This new fairytale is the Broadway musical "", 'Once Upon a One More Time', ', a spectacle powered by the song catalog of the Princess of Pop: Britney Spears.', 'Once Upon a One More Time', ' is certainly not the first piece of media interested in putting a modern, empowering spin on fairytales — even the notion of the ""strong independent princess"" has become a tale as old as time. But it certainly is the most fun. Spears's hits and impeccable dancing from director/choreographers Keone and Mari Madrid make ', 'Once Upon a One More Time', "" an irresistible party. And quite frankly, that's what I want from a Britney Spears musical more than anything else."", 'An all-powerful Narrator (Adam Godley) dictates the lives of everyone in ', 'Once Upon a One More Time', '. Fairytale characters lie in wait until a child chooses to read their stories, at which point the  Narrator summons them to live out the same tales over and over. ""We do not make fairytales, we follow them,"" he repeatedly insists.', ""The princesses' newfound desire for change comes from Betty Friedan's 1963 book "", 'The Feminine Mystique', "", which The Notorious O.F.G. (Original Fairy Godmother, played by Brooke Dillman in eccentric-aunt fashion) bestows on the princesses' book club. Given that setup, one shouldn't expect a revelatory feminist story from "", 'Once Upon a One More Time', "": Friedan's book kicked off second-wave feminism, and Friedan famously excluded queer women from her movement, both long outdated notions by today's intersectional, fourth-wave standards."", 'A hastily drawn gay subplot and cursory nods to modern women's annoyances (through lines like ""You're so much prettier when you smile,"" which elicited loud noises of disgust from my audience) come off as Hartmere's attempts to offset these concerns. Luckily, Friedan doesn't factor heavily into the musical (until the end, which contains a revelation that unwittingly invites the audience to root for her) — just the general notion that she wrote about women wanting to escape rigid, societally prescribed roles.', ""But like I said, if you're willing to accept "", 'Once Upon a One More Time', ' as a kind of period piece in which feminism is new, you'll have a fantastic time, because there is still plenty to unequivocally love. The score is the obvious thing — Hartmere changed a few lyrics in each song to fit the plot, but high-energy hits like ""Circus,"" ""Womanizer,"" ""...Baby One More Time,"" and ""Oops!...I Did It Again"" are still perfectly recognizable. (""Toxic"" stays entirely intact, and even though the lyrics don't quite make sense plot-wise, hearing Godley and Jennifer Simard, as Cinderella's stepmother, sing it is so exhilarating that you won't care.)', 'But the dance is truly what makes ', 'Once Upon a One More Time', "" worth the price of admission. The Madrids are choreographers first, and it shows — their hip-hop- and '90s music video-flavored moves tell a story. The princes dance with unabashed swagger from the start, taking up the whole stage with confidence. The princesses' moves begin small and ultra-precise, almost stilted, but have an underlying sharpness that suggests a fierceness inside them. Their choreography gradually gets bigger and freer — that is, more like the men's — as they tap into that fierceness and find their independence."", 'Among the large ensemble cast, Justin Guarini is the undisputed standout as the womanizing Prince Charming. He gets two of Britney's biggest songs — ""Circus"" and ""Oops!...I Did It Again"" — and delivers them in full rockstar mode to make them the show's best numbers alongside ""Toxic."" Guarini and Simard deliver both the vocal power and impeccable comic timing (Simard's Stepmother is giving Jennifer Coolidge) — her commanding entrance during ""Work Bitch"" is one to behold.

That question is at the core of ', 'Life of Pi', ', a fantastical fable about survival, faith, and how stories help us make sense of our lives.', 'Visually, the play is a deeply wondrous spectacle that teems with beauty and brutality. Narratively, the script does less to impress, as if written at times in magic marker, and supporting performances could use some shading. Bottom line for this work on Broadway following runs in London and Cambridge, Massachusetts: The display’s the thing.', 'Based on Yann Martel’s 2001 novel that spawned an Oscar-winning movie, Lolita Chakrabarti’s stage version begins in 1978 in a hospital room in Mexico. Pi Patel (Hiran Abeysekera, captivating) is questioned by representatives of the Canadian Embassy (Kirstin Louie) and Japanese Ministry of Transport (Daisuke Tsuji). They’re after facts on how the Tsimtsum, a cargo ship bound for Canada, sank eight months earlier – and how Pi defied death. He tells them.', 'The action moves between the infirmary, Pi’s home, and the middle of the ocean. In 1976 Pondicherry, India, happy-go-lucky Pi’s life in a zoo comes into focus through a series of bite-sized scenes. Butterflies dance in the air, and a giraffe cranes its graceful neck. We meet his zookeeper parents (Rajesh Bose and Mahira Kakkar) and sister (Sonya Venugopal), as well as a zebra, orangutans, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, ', 'brought to life by puppets', ' and multiple puppeteers.', ""Each beast is dangerous, a point Pi’s father makes by sacrificing a goat to the tiger. (Note: This is not a kids' show.) The scene shifts to a bustling marketplace, where spiritually inquisitive Pi looks to leaders at a local church, mosque, and temple for answers to his big questions. “If God is good and kind, why is there so much violence in the world?” he asks."", 'Political unrest compels Pi’s family to leave India with their animals for Canada aboard the Tsimtsum. About 40 minutes into the play, there’s a cry of “Storm coming!” and everything changes. The ship sinks, and from the bare stage, a small lifeboat magically surfaces like a sea creature. Pi climbs into the craft, and he’s not alone. An orangutan, hyena, injured zebra, and Richard Parker have busted out of containers and taken refuge there.', 'Eventually, only Pi and the tiger remain. To outlast the maneater, he tames the beast and reconciles with its killer instinct – and his own, after going against his beliefs and eating a sea turtle to avoid starvation. When the government investigators in Mexico doubt his tale, Pi spins a parallel yarn – minus animals but with human predators instead.', 'What’s the takeaway? Maybe it’s as simple as to never give up – and everything that conveys. While lost at sea, Pi talks with the ghost of his sister, who can’t believe he still has faith. “Look at where you are,” she says. “But I’m alive,” Pi responds.', 'In the end, there’s no question that director Max Webster’s staging is a technical marvel that makes the most of its moving parts. Those include amazing puppetry; evocative scenic, lighting, and sound design; and transporting video and animation effects that conjure the ocean and the sky above.', '“My story will make you believe in God,” Pi insists.

Juicy (Marcel Spears) and his family are celebrating the nuptials of his mother Tedra (Nikki Crawford) to his Uncle Rev (Billy Eugene Jones), just one week after the murder of his father Pap (also Jones). Sound familiar?', 'Fat Ham', ' ', 'isn’t a scene-for-scene adaptation of the tragedy', ', though. The 95-minute play begins with Tio (played with hilarity by Chris Herbie Holland) casually watching porn on his cell phone as Juicy resentfully decorates the backyard. The smoking barbecue grill, colorful globe lights, and bunches of balloons look like harbingers of a happy celebration — but Pap’s ghost has other plans.', 'Pap, dressed in a white suit and covered in a red-checkered tablecloth, appears to Juicy to exhort vengeance. He was shanked in the neck in prison, and Rev orchestrated the murder to gain control of the family barbecue business. Juicy, who is pursuing a degree in human resources, prefers working with people over pigs. And he isn’t sure he’s capable — or willing — to exact bloody revenge.', 'Juicy sports a bedazzled “Mama’s Boy” shirt, but Tedra, wearing bedazzled booty shorts, is unable to give Juicy the love and support he needs. She makes matters worse when she tells him she spent his college tuition fund on a bathroom renovation.', 'Under Saheem Ali’s direction, all the characters move between tenderness and toughness with ease. The back and forth is thrilling, and the audience even becomes part of this energy with occasional fourth-wall breaks.', 'The strongest performances are from the young characters, who have more self-awareness than their Shakespearean counterparts. Spears plays Juicy with a gentle, exacting power that might make the audience think he is capable of butchering his uncle — or maybe he just wants to change the family legacy. Opal (Adrianna Mitchell) is a headstrong Ophelia that moves to the beat of her own drum. Holland gets a scene-stealing soliloquy, in which a stoned Tio recalls receiving fellatio from a gingerbread man while playing a VR game.', 'The play’s brilliance is in its ability to tie Shakespeare into this contemporary family’s experience, even if the characters don’t see it. When Juicy quotes a line from ', 'Romeo & Juliet', ', Tedra accuses him of watching too much PBS. “If you bring up that dead old white man one mo time…” she warns. There are plenty more references to ', 'Hamlet', ', including the perfectly delivered line “there’s the rub” (pulled from the famous ""to be or not to be"" monologue) and a brief aside in verse to set up a game of charades. And when Tio tells Juicy their former classmate Yorick overdosed, Juicy cradles a smiley-face balloon instead of a skull.', 'Throughout the play, others repeatedly call Juicy “tender” and “soft.” “You was powerful when you were a baby,” Rev says. “And you got soft. And you was nothing like your daddy or like me. You was soft. And the men in our family ain’t soft.”', 'But maybe tender is good. (Tender pork ribs sure are.) Ijames takes Hamlet’s political and social themes and marinates them for a modern audience. There’s no crown to transfer here, just generations of toxic masculinity to pass down and homophobia to unpack.', 'Fat Ham', ' is less about seeking revenge and more about Juicy winning justice.

Act 1 is a tight sequence of hilarity. One of the best laughs is prompted by John Darling sporting headphones so the stage crew can feed lines from backstage.

'Ohio State Murders' review — Audra McDonald chills and thrills in Adrienne Kennedy drama,"The most important thing to highlight about ', 'Ohio State Murders', ' on Broadway is that it is here. At long last, it is here, with a trio of Black theatre icons (and icons, period) attached. Two are ', 'Audra McDonald', ', the six-time Tony-winning star of the production, and ', 'James Earl Jones', ', for whom the theatre housing ', 'Ohio State Murders', ' has just been renamed.', ""And finally, there's Adrienne Kennedy, who wrote such masterworks as "", 'Funnyhouse of a Negro', "" in her decades-long Off-Broadway career that pushed the boundaries of theatrical writing. At 91 years old, she is now a Broadway playwright. With a Theater Hall of Fame induction and multiple other lifetime achievement awards under her belt already, it's an honor long overdue."", 'One can wager various guesses as to the delay. ', 'Kennedy herself cites racism', ', and she would know — parts of ', 'Ohio State Murders', "" are based on her own experiences facing academic discrimination as an aspiring writer at her alma mater of the title. Another is the belief that mainstream audiences (and even theatremakers) might not know what to make of Kennedy's experimental writing, which often abandons realism in favor of symbolism, allegories, and pretzel-like twists of time and space to explore the Black experience."", ""Not that that's any particular excuse. We can't expand what flies as Broadway theatre if no one dares to try. This Kenny Leon-directed production is imperfect, but it deserves credit for trying and for what it gets right, including McDonald's riveting lead performance."", 'Ohio State Murders', "", which features one of Kennedy's more linear plots, is a good choice for testing the waters. This still being Kennedy, of course, it's told out of chronological order, by the writer Suzanne Alexander (McDonald). Suzanne is giving a lecture on why violence features so heavily in her works: because she's also a grieving mother whose twin daughters were murdered, and the memory still weighs heavily on her mind."", 'An out-of-order retelling makes sense for such a story: Suzanne is trying to piece together multiple fragmented, traumatic memories — of getting underestimated for her talents, then rejected from the English program, then pregnant, then expelled, then undone by loss — in real time as she talks about all this openly for the first time.', 'Ohio State Murders', "" is at its best when Suzanne is unraveling her memories for the audience. The short scenes of dialogue, most of which are with her English professor Robert Hampshire, stall the play's momentum. In those moments, Leon can't quite seem to decide whether his "", 'Ohio State Murders', ' is closer to a memory play or a theatrical memoir.', ""But we can't disregard Hampshire, though he's unremarkably aloof and Bryce Pinkham plays him as such. He's also the father of Suzanne's twins (this isn't a spoiler), and is, theatrically, her perfect foil."", 'He and Suzanne each deliver lectures during ', 'Ohio State Murders', "", both with a certain emotionlessness. But while his matter-of-fact tone is disinterested, Suzanne's is anything but. There is a palpable, thinly veiled rage simmering beneath most of McDonald's expertly layered performance. Rage at Ohio State for dismissing her writing talents because of her Blackness, at Hampshire for tossing her aside the minute she became pregnant, at everyone involved in covering up the identity of her child's murderer because they were (you guessed it) white."", ""McDonald is so transformative that in her few moments of bygone joy, such as when she convincingly plays with a pink scarf as though it were a real child, we momentarily forget Suzanne's anger. But when it brings her to her knees as she finally, for one piercing moment, lets all her pain boil over, we're reminded anew that the most violent force in "", 'Ohio State Murders', ' is racism itself. ""Did you write this yourself?"" Hampshire doubts, for example, of a brilliant assignment Suzanne submits for his class. Small microaggressions and murderous acts are all rooted in the same hatred.', ""Kennedy lets this point suggest itself, and Leon's direction of the actors smartly preserves the subtlety of her writing. Beowulf Boritt's set, too, with library stacks akimbo in front of a gaping, dark ravine and snowfall, sets the sinister tone without a word, aided by Allen Lee Hughes's lighting."", ""If you're looking for a show that announces its themes with pomp and circumstance, "", 'Ohio State Murders', "" isn't it. Such an even-keeled approach might make a longer show dull, but at just 75 minutes, "", 'Ohio State Murders', "" holds attention overall amid its muddy moments. And as McDonald's performance attests, nothing is as it seems on the surface. There's plenty bubbling below.

Oof. Said ""mansion,"" as suggested by Walt Spangler's enticing set, is a rent-controlled apartment with two stories, at least six rooms, and cushy, if ill-maintained, furnishings. Meanwhile, I know people who shell out comparable rent for places that could fit double on the ', 'Hayes Theater', ' stage.', 'The apartment's tenant, recent widower Walter ""Pops"" Washington, risks such a downgrade if his landlord succeeds in evicting him. (Pops isn't budging.) The soul-sucking ruthlessness of the NYC real estate market is just one theme of Stephen Adly Guirgis's Pulitzer-winning play that has (unfortunately) aged like wine since its 2014 Off-Broadway premiere.', 'Racism in policing is another. Pops is also battling his old employer, the NYPD, for just compensation for being shot off-duty by a white officer eight years before. These are the main conflicts in what is otherwise a sitcom-esque slice-of-life show. Director Austin Pendleton, returning from off Broadway, fluidly stages ', 'Between Riverside and Crazy', "" in such a way that makes us feel like we're peering through a window as we pass by. A scene in which the set rotates continuously as conversations take place particularly achieves this effect."", ""It's almost as though we've stopped to marvel at the apartment, and had our curiosity further seized once we notice the people inside. In two-plus hours, Pops and a series of supporting characters slowly reveal themselves to be more than they seem."", ""Pops's paroled son, Junior (a fine Common in his Broadway debut), is distant and shifty, but he quietly craves his father's love. Rosal Colón is a standout as Junior's flighty girlfriend Lulu, who demands the respect she's worth. Victor Almanzar, as recovering addict Oswaldo, has a nervous energy that turns to mania directed at Pops when he falls off the wagon again. All see Pops as a father figure, who dryly bucks the label but is fiercely protective of them in his own unfussy way."", ""They're complemented by a few non-down-and-outs of the bunch: Detective Audry O'Connor (Elizabeth Canavan) and Lieutenant Dave Caro (Michael Rispoli), Pops's former coworkers begging him to settle his lawsuit, and a woman known only as Church Lady (a tantalizing Liza Colón-Zayas), who comes to give Pops communion and brings about another bodily miracle. They, too, reveal new sides and motivations as the play progresses."", 'All but Common are reprising roles they originated in 2014, so every performance feels as lived-in as the apartment. Henderson especially delivers a masterclass in saying volumes with a mere expression, and making his every word — from sharp jabs at his housemates to thoughtful observations on his Blackness and his profession — land perfectly with seemingly no effort.', 'Lines like ""This [settlement] ain’t about no Black, white, or blue — this is about the green"" could feel preachy in a less skilled actor's hands, but they remain as astute as on the page in Henderson's. And remember, every character is more than their outward presentation. The genius of Guirgis's writing is in inclining us to stand with Pops in these moments of truth, even once he admits to some morally gray deception. The same goes for every expertly crafted character.', 'Between Riverside and Crazy', "" is about the lengths people will go to make out alright in an unforgiving world.

At intermission, a reel plays of lead actors Jeremy Pope and Paul Bettany, in character as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol, painting, roller-skating, and generally having a ball."", 'And then the actual play starts up, about the titular artistic partnership Basquiat and Warhol formed in the 1980s. It can best be described as a perfect example of Warhol's artistic philosophy, as he states it in the script: ""Why can't it just be about nothing?"" The show suffers from forgettable writing, but there are a few vibrant moments, thanks entirely to the lead performances that are a marvel (no Bettany/Vision pun intended) to witness.', 'The artists’ collaboration actually happened, inspiring the broad strokes of the plot: Agent Bruno Bischofberger (Erik Jensen) convinced Basquiat and Warhol to work together despite neither wanting to. They developed a close friendship despite their myriad differences: art style, age, race, career trajectory, and general personality.', ""In nailing each idiosyncrasy of Basquiat and Warhol, Pope and Bettany, who received acclaim for originating these roles in London, couldn't be better. With a little help from a wig and glasses, Bettany looks and sounds like Warhol reincarnated, achieving the difficult task of making soft-spoken aloofness compelling. It's an even more remarkable feat considering he's competing for attention with Pope's firecracker of a Basquiat. He inhabits the sardonic young upstart with overconfident swagger to spare, practically bouncing off the "", 'Samuel J.

Their conversations, about the purpose of art and their personal reasons for making it, offer little new insight to anyone with even a passing knowledge of Basquiat and Warhol.', 'In the first act, the most novel thing about ', 'The Collaboration', "" instead is the blending of various art styles on stage. I don't mean Warhol's and Basquiat's — we don't see the work they produce together — but the visual art, film, music, and dance all included in this piece of theatre. It's a testament to how art forms inform each other, how any one can inspire new creations and breakthroughs in another."", ""The plot, on the other hand, only kicks into high gear in Act 2 with the arrival of Krysta Rodriguez, in a commanding turn of her own as Basquiat's girlfriend Maya. A conversation between her and Warhol reveals an emergency that introduces real stakes, particularly for Basquiat. Pope gets another opportunity to explode with every bit of energy he's got, though this time out of anguish rather than triumph."", ""McCarten leaves out one major moment in the trajectory of the artists' collaboration: the part where their friendship burned out just as quickly as it began, between the failure of their exhibit and both icons' untimely deaths.

A few skits could use pruning. Expletives fly like nobody’s business – 49 F-bombs and 58 N-words, per a scan of the script. That makes sense for a comedy with no interest in being polite.', 'The only thing that’s really shocking in this play, directed with go-for-it zest by Stevie Walker-Webb, is the cast’s bow.

As always, the play tells the story of Nora Helmer, a wife and mother who finally summons the power to stand tall on her own two feet.', 'British director Jamie Lloyd ingeniously runs full tilt with that image. For nearly all of the play’s unbroken two hours, Nora remains rooted in a chair (vaguely Norwegian, a nod to Ibsen’s background) situated downstage, close to the audience.', 'Even when Nora practices a dance she’s performing at a holiday party, she doesn’t get up – it’s as if she’s doing chair yoga. Only in the final few moments does Nora rise on her own, stand erect, risk everything, and walk out. To go where? That’s the question.', ""The hallmark of Lloyd's vision — he directed "", 'Betrayal', ' with Tom Hiddleston', ' on Broadway and ', 'Cyrano de Bergerac', ' with James McAvoy', ' at BAM — is absolute certainty. That extends from the first time we see Nora to the last and everything in between. Chastain appears in her chair about 15 minutes before showtime. Arms and legs crossed, she gazes into the audience as she repeatedly rotates on a turntable.', 'It’s a brilliant and economical visual – and not just because Chastain’s so great she’ll make your head spin. Nora is a woman whose life goes in circles, and in this revival, everything orbits around her. Whenever characters talk, they stand near Nora, slide up a seat by her, or – what nerve! – share her chair without even asking.', 'The story takes place at Christmas, and celebratory spirits are doubly high. Nora’s husband Torvald (Arian Moayed) is being promoted at his bank. He’s a big deal. In his mind, Nora, aka “Birdie,” as he calls her, is childish – like their three kids cared for by Anne-Marie (Tasha Lawrence).', 'Torvald is wrong.

So does her friend and confidante, Kristine (Jesmille Darbouze). But Nora is on the brink of being exposed. Not even her dear friend Dr. Rank (Michael Patrick Thornton) can help.', 'Written in 1879, Ibsen’s play packs sticks of dramatic dynamite as it takes on marriage, money, secrets, reputation, and power.

They’ll be part of it every step of the way.', 'During that decade, Larry obsessively combs through 30 years of the family’s vintage home movies and snaps countless candids and meticulously arranged pictures of his parents. His bottomless curiosity about Irv and Jean turns the aging couple’s lives inside out. “What I’m doing,” says Larry, “is looking for the life beyond the frame.”', 'Playwright Sharr White (', 'The Other Place', ') finds similar narrative inspiration for this rich drama about the marvels and mysteries of an ordinary family. (It’s a selective portrait – Larry’s two brothers are mentioned in passing, and that’s it.) White looks beyond content in Sultan’s book to imagine inevitable behind-the-scenes small- and large-scale dramas drummed up by Larry’s posing and probing. Art isn’t easy – just ask these accommodating parents with lives of their own.', 'From the jump, it’s obvious White isn’t taking a realistic route. Larry periodically breaks the fourth wall (as do his parents) and summons an invisible projectionist to roll homemade family films and cue up pictures, as if he’s giving a photography lecture back at California College of the Arts. Scene-setting text projections – “Terminal A,” “The Silent Treatment,” “Departures” – pop up in the unbroken 105-minute production as the action shifts in time and location.', 'Under Bartlett Sher’s assured direction, all three actors deftly capture the play’s shifting tones. Burstein shines as Larry, an artist whose work may not always be in his parents’ best interests. Wanamaker’s Jean is happily resigned to her life, but she’s nobody’s fool. Irv, a salesman-turned-executive unceremoniously pushed into retirement, emerges as a fascinating figure. Credit Lane’s depiction that toggles back and forth from funny to poignant in a flash.', 'A striking aspect of Sher’s production is that the actors aren’t lookalikes for the people they’re playing. Lane and Burstein are nearly the same age. It’s a play about memories, after all, so there’s distance between how people are seen and how they really are. Early on, Larry claims the story “isn’t about me, it’s about them.” Irv drolly responds, “Larry may say it’s about us, but trust me. It’s about him.” Perhaps the casting lends wiggle room. If you’ve ever had questions or concerns about your parents, perhaps it’s about you, too.', 'Irv calls the project an ""investigation,"" questioning whether Larry’s staged pictures reveal anything authentic and wondering why he’s spending so much time away from his own family. The play considers that Larry’s motive wasn’t just about exploring. It was also about exploding myths and images suggesting a storybook life.', 'As in any play about a family, White covers expected territory about generational divides, legacies, mortality, and finally, love. Eventually, a clear picture develops about what was driving Larry’s parent-focused project. It was to “stop time,” he says. “I want you to live forever.” But even beyond the frame, time ticks on.', 'Pictures From Home', ' is at Studio 54.

"'Topdog/Underdog' review — with Corey Hawkins and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, this play shows its lasting power","Back on Broadway in a top-notch new production, Suzan-Lori Parks’s 2002 Pulitzer Prize winner, ', 'Topdog/Underdog', ', bubbles over with timeless talking points. The always intriguing playwright reckons with race, identity, fractured families, and the elusive chase for grace. At its core – and right there in the title – the play also concerns power. Someone’s always got more of it, and that disparity breeds trouble.', 'For this harrowing and humorous two-hander to reach its full firepower, it takes actors equal in might. Director Kenny Leon has cast a pair of aces who consistently match each other across the tragicomic tone shifts.', 'Broadway rookie Yahya Abdul-Mateen II went nude in his Emmy-winning ', 'Watchmen', ' role, but he’s never been more emotionally naked than in his performance as Booth. He nails the recklessness — and in the end, raw sorrow — of the brash younger brother. And Corey Hawkins, a Tony nominee for ', 'Six Degrees of Separation', ', gives a star turn that’s persuasively measured and lived-in as big brother Lincoln.', 'Beyond their ripely symbolic, larger-than-life names, these young Black men share traumatic histories (“raggedy recollections,” as one puts it), uncertain futures, and inevitable fates. The setting, according to the program, is here, and the time is now. Those narrative details manage to be both specific and all over the map.', ""Arnulfo Maldonado's set also goes more than one way. The depiction of Booth’s residence, a room in an urban boarding house, is down-to-earth in its claustrophobic shabbiness. But beyond its walls are visible swoops of gold drapery, suggesting something less realistic, somewhere shiny and out of reach."", 'Booth squeaks by from what he can “boost.” He’s convinced con games are the way to economic opportunity and a step up from shoplifting. He needs cash to win over Grace, a woman this dreamer-schemer claims loves him, “but she don’t know it yet.” He clumsily rehearses moves and patter for three-card Monte on an improvised table of milk crates and cardboard. Booth wants to team up in the scam with Lincoln, a former badass at “throwing cards.”', 'Since quitting the con and getting kicked to the curb by his wife – a crushing blow that involved Booth – Lincoln has made a living by dying. He wears whiteface and a ratty frock beard, frock coat, and top hat to pose as Abraham Lincoln in an arcade, where people pay money to pretend to kill the 16th president. It’s a job out of a strange nightmare – if not the musical ', 'Assassins', '.', 'It’s pointedly grim stuff. But Parks pulls spiky laughs from the bleak circumstances. Convinced his cost-cutting bosses will replace him (how’s that for an evergreen subject), Lincoln exaggeratedly polishes Honest Abe’s death scene to grin-inducing effect. Similarly, Booth gleefully savors the spoils of a busy day of stealing suits – one for him, one for Lincoln.', 'But the brotherly love only extends so far. The siblings’ inability to come together on the card con scheme, and a plot twist involving a family inheritance, sets the stage for calamity. When someone has next to nothing, losing that can only lead to extremes.', 'This production establishes its tone before it begins. A massive Old Glory looms large and conveys a weighty sense of history. ', 'Topdog/Underdog', ' does that, too, in its own theatrical way.

'Almost Famous' review — musical adaptation of hit film doesn't rock as hard,"Cameron Crowe’s musical adaptation of his much-loved 22-year-old Oscar-winner, ', 'Almost Famous', ', gets off to a very promising start. So much so you silently hope Crowe (book and lyrics), Tom Kitt (music and lyrics), and director Jeremy Herrin can sustain the high level for the whole 2.5 hours. Long story short, no such luck.', 'Fortunately, the show is filled with fine performances and getup that takes us back a half-century without looking like a costume party. The energizing early vignettes come packed with rockers, groupies, backstage bustle, swirling doorways, blazing stage lights, flared jeans, macrame halter tops and crocheted hot pants. We know the time, the place, who’s who, and what’s at stake.', 'In California circa 1973, socially awkward 15-year-old William Miller (Casey Likes) is aching to be seen and heard. He plans to make that happen, like Crowe did, as a music journalist. He lands an assignment for Rolling Stone to cover Stillwater, an up-and-coming group behind the scratchy hit “Fever Dog.” Guitarist Russell Hammond (Chris Wood) has the skills, voice, mystique, and long hair (parted down the middle) of a star.', 'William’s rigid widowed mom (Anika Larsen, channeling Frances McDormand from the film) reluctantly gives him the green light to go. William quickly discovers onstage rock gods are just self-serving neurotics behind the scenes.', 'Up to this point, the focus is squarely on William, who does everything he can to make his dream happen. He pesters the esteemed rock critic Lester Bangs (Rob Colletti). He charms Russell and frontman Jeff Bebe (Drew Gehling, game for anything). He befriends Penny Lane (an iridescent Solea Pfeiffer, in the role made famous by Kate Hudson), who favors the term “band aid” to ""groupie"" and recklessly prefers Russell over everyone else.', 'William stays busy. And then… he turns passive. He becomes just another person in the room, the one with the tape recorder. Things that happen between Russell and Penny and within Stillwater have nothing to do with William. Without a strong focus, the story falls slack and meanders.', 'Even when it’s blurry, ', 'Almost Famous', ' has smart things to say about the power of music, weirdness of celebrity, force of family, and bittersweetness of life. It’s also a love story – a few of them. There’s William and Penny, Penny and Russell, and, more subtly, Crowe and pop legend Joni Mitchell. He’s seen to it that she looms large in the show. A tiny fragment of her achy ballad, “River,” plays in the background onscreen. The musical turns it into a lyrical point of connection. “Call me if you ever need a rescue, or a river to skate away on,” Penny tells William. “‘River.’ Joni Mitchell,” he responds. Later in the show it becomes their dramatic duet.', 'Showcasing the song and its peerless poetry on stage is a bold move. The same goes for Elton John’s irresistible “Tiny Dancer,” which the Stillwater band members sing in the movie and show as they mend fences. Music heals. They’re great songs, of course, and that cuts two ways.', 'New songs by Crowe and Kitt (', 'Next to Normal', ') are easy on the ears but don’t quite rise as high. “1973,” which begins as a solo for Likes and builds into a rousing group number, is a lively show opener. “Morocco,” sung beautifully by Pfeiffer, expresses Penny’s desires and, like the character, is pretty but vague. “The Night-Time Sky’s Got Nothing on You,” a duet between Russell and Penny, is a vocal highlight.', 'In the end ', 'Almost Famous', ' is a mid-level musical that lives up to its title.

Following an Off-Broadway run that wrapped in January, ', 'Kimberly Akimbo', ' is now in residence at the ', 'Booth Theatre', ' with the original cast and every bit of its wondrous quirkiness intact. In fact, the show is more polished and endearing than before.', 'Anyone (including myself) who fears this charmer might get swallowed up in a Broadway house can rest easy. The show, created by David Lindsay-Abaire (book and lyrics) and Jeanine Tesori (music), has found the ideal home.', 'The luxury of a home-sweet-home is foreign to Kimberly (Victoria Clark) in this story based on Lindsay-Abaire’s same-named 2001 play. In 1999 New Jersey, Kim has an extremely rare condition causing her to age at more than four times the normal speed. She just celebrated her 16th birthday, and in doing so, she’s turned the corner on her life expectancy.', 'There’s more. Her dad, Buddy (Steven Boyer), hits the bottle with alarming regularity. Her pregnant mom, Pattie (Alli Mauzey), harbors neuroses and a big family secret. Her aunt Debra (Bonnie Milligan) is a con woman who only looks out for herself.', 'Kim finds a friend and an escape in Seth (Justin Cooley), a geeky fellow student who is obsessed with anagrams and, like her, has a dicey home situation. They initially come together for an ill-conceived science class project, but their bond grows deeper. Around Seth, this girl who looks like she’s 72 can actually act just like the 16-year-old she is.', 'Black comedy is tricky to pull off. How do you balance the bitter with the sweet? Specifically, how do you find the humor in a distressing subject matter of a teen whose death is coming at her at warp speed?', 'The creators succeed with a story that goes to serious and seriously cockamamie places (cue Debra’s nutty check-fraud scene) and a batch of songs that are rich, melodic, and multi-toned. There’s also an ace in the hole – Seth and Kim are the most irresistible odd couple since Harold and Maude.', 'As scenes shift from a skating rink to Kim’s home and school and beyond, the show spills over with heart, hilarity, hummable songs, and an evergreen, urgent message to live every day like it’s your last. In keeping with the go-for-it attitude, the whole cast makes the most of every minute.', 'Tony winner Clark (', 'The Light in the Piazza', ') delights as the smart, resilient, and gutsy Kim, who realizes wishes can’t make things better – but she can. Clark is so convincing as a teenager that when she shows up dressed up like a 70something grandmother as part of Debra’s grift, it’s almost a shock.', 'Cooley is a perfect foil. His Broadway debut is as confident and winning as they come. Boyer and Mauzey are terrific as terrible parents, and Milligan is a belting powerhouse who makes larceny look fun.', 'The ensemble also shines bright. That includes Olivia Elease Hardy, Fernell Hogan, Michael Iskander, and Nina White as Kim’s classmates, who double as a sort of Greek chorus to harmonize at key moments.', 'In addition to assembling a wonderful cast, director Jessica Stone shows a keen eye for detail.

'The Old Man and the Pool' review — Mike Birbiglia dives into his mortality and earns waves of laughter,"Watching comedian Mike Birbiglia on stage is always a blast. It’s like reconnecting with an old friend, albeit one with infinite issues and a habit of taking the roundabout route to get to the point.', 'Birbiglia is totally on brand in his largely delightful solo show, ', 'The Old Man and the Pool', '. The 44-year-old author and actor dives into the choppy waters of his own mortality and comes up not only with waves of laughs, but also deep reflections about love and appreciation for how lucky he is (and we are) to be alive.', 'That will come as no surprise to anyone who’s seen this crafty performer’s previous pieces, in which he mined the funny from some dark situations. These include his dangerous sleep disorder (', 'Sleepwalk with Me', '), bad dates (', 'My Girlfriend’s Boyfriend', '), and parenting perils (', 'The New One', ').', 'Director and longtime collaborator Seth Barrish stages ', 'The Old Man and the Pool', ' simply. Birbiglia wears blue street clothes and stands before a giant curved wall, designed by Beowulf Boritt, that recalls a pool and briefly doubles as a slip-and-slide.', 'The story begins with a single breath that sets off recollections that dip in and out of the present. In his trademark style, Birbiglia packs his narrative with flashbacks, curlicues, non sequiturs, and one-liners. The story is here, there, everywhere. It’s how he rolls, and he overall ties things up, save for a few loose ends.', 'Firstly, a doctor’s test reveals Birbiglia has inherited his family’s cardiac issues. His dad and granddad both suffered heart attacks in their 50s. Physicians naturally advise him to eat healthy and swim regularly. Yeah, right. He gobbles pizza by the pie, not the slice. He’s a storyteller, not Michael Phelps. “I have a drowner’s body,” quips Birbiglia, who nevertheless reluctantly heads to a Brooklyn YMCA pool.', 'From the heart doc’s office he travels back to his youth, when his distaste for sports took root. First it was wrestling, which he hated. Then it was swimming at a Massachusetts YMCA pool, a place he associates with pee and chlorine and an unshakable odor.', '“It had that smell like when you’re little and a kid lets you smell under their cast.” Gross, and hilarious. Seeing elderly naked women and men – especially one ancient manspreader – haunts his memory.', ""Later traumas come via bladder cancer and Type 2 diabetes; Birbiglia has truly been through the wringer. More health concerns float up when Birbiglia and his wife discover black mold is lurking in their daughter's bedroom. That means moving into an Airbnb. This unresolved detour simply sets up a dad joke about the lack of breakfast: “There’s no b.” This "", 'Pool', ' has a few of these shallow dips.', 'But this story also goes below the surface. Birbiglia shares that growing up, his family always said “Take care” instead of “I love you,” and decades later he still does that. But things change. He recalls being in a pool with his daughter, who said something unintelligible when they were goofing around underwater. When they popped up for air, he remembers, “She said, ‘I love you, Dad.’ I said, ‘I love you too, Oona.’”', 'Birbiglia doesn’t bend toward sentimentality.

'Walking with Ghosts' review — Gabriel Byrne conjures spirits and stories in his earnest solo show,"The stage is set for memory lane at Gabriel Byrne’s low-simmering solo show ', 'Walking with Ghosts', '. A series of prosceniums that successively shrink as they recede from the audience simply and efficiently suggest traveling backward.', 'That’s where the Irish author and actor heads in his adaptation of his 2021 memoir of the same title. Beyond some lighting cues and bits of music, the 2-hour production directed by Lonny Price (', 'Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar & Grill', ') is essentially a no-frills affair. Its greatest special effect: Byrne himself.', 'Now 72 with a resume that includes films (', 'The Usual Suspects', '), TV (', 'In Treatment', '), and Broadway (', 'A Touch of the Poet', '), Byrne is an able and appealing yarn-spinner. He summons a few various characters with a deft gesture or vocal shift. His tour of the past begins by recalling a dream that drew him home to Dublin.', 'Byrne sees his cash-strapped, flea-ridden youthful self as a “ghost boy.” As a kid, he bought a book jammed with 1,000 jokes and memorized them “so that people would like me for making them laugh.” Like the one about two cannibals eating a clown. “Does this taste funny?” one asks.', 'Flecked with wry humor, Byrne’s stage memoir leans more melancholy than merry. That’s par for the course. The specter of death looms fairly large. Dressed in a casual suit, Byrne takes a chronological path to introduce “ghosts” and their indelible marks on him. They include his working-class mother and father, a barrel maker, his doomed mentally ill sister, a friend who drowned, his grandmother who indulged his love for the cinema – and corn flakes.', 'It’s a deeply personal story, and there’s not much attempt to put his experiences in a larger context. Each self-contained, bite-sized section ends in a blackout. Connecting the dots between vignettes in a more powerful thematic way would give the show a cumulative wallop that now feels somewhat lacking.', 'Still, there are standout scenes. One of the best concerns a shopping splurge with his loving mother to buy clothes for his first communion. Money was tight, and his mother paid for the outfit with coins. As a child he was mortified. “I looked away,” Byrne remembers. “I was ashamed I was ashamed.”', 'At age 11, Byrne went to seminary school, where a predatory priest plied him with wine, put a hand on his knee, and vowed secrecy. “My child’s faith and trust in the world had been destroyed,” says Byrne.', 'Following that traumatic event, Byrne was adrift. He found work as a plumber, a dishwasher, and a hotel bathroom attendant. “You suspect this job might not be where you were born for,” Byrne observes.', 'Life changed when he found his way into an amateur acting company, where he at last felt welcome. Scruffy productions of Shakespeare plays became his drama school and eventually led to his life’s work.', 'Byrne doesn’t dwell on his starry career or his celebrity. He name-drops the late, great Welsh movie star Richard Burton, who he worked with, as a way to explore their shared battles with booze. His revelation that he’s been sober for more than two decades drew applause from the audience.', 'Byrne concludes ', 'Walking with Ghosts', ' with another dream.

She sang the iconic Act 1 finale “Don’t Rain on My Parade” during the first season and later performed the number on the Tony Awards. In the show’s final season, the character made her Broadway debut in ', 'Funny Girl', ' and won the Tony for her performance.', 'While Michele won’t win a Tony Award for this outing – Tonys are only given to performers who originated the role, and Michele replaces ', 'Beanie Feldstein', ', who left the production over the summer – she is making quite the splash in her first time on Broadway in over a decade. It’s impossible to parse out every layer of meta-theatricality at play here, not least because the show itself is a show-within-a-show about a starry-eyed Ziegfeld comic hoping to become the “greatest star.”', 'But even without all the added contextual layers, Michele stands alone as a singular Broadway performer, one who can pack a house and command a crowd and also hit all the right notes and laughs. And even years on, she brings the same bright-eyed optimism and ingenuity that made audiences fall in love with her. When she sings “Don’t Rain on My Parade,” the audience feels as if they are somehow fulfilling a dream alongside her, and while premature claps and mid-song standing ovations can seem distracting, it’s all a part of this singular theatregoing experience. You, the audience, are also part of this spectacle.', 'Broadway and television favorite Tovah Feldshuh joined the company with Michele as Fanny’s overprotective mother, and she chews on all the scenery, stealing the show with numbers like “Henry Street” when Fanny returns home to a party the neighborhood where she grew up. Jared Grimes, who earned a Tony nomination for his jubilant and tap-tastic performance as Fanny’s friend Eddie Ryan, continues to give 110% in a thankless side role.

'A Christmas Carol' review — Jefferson Mays's inventive solo adaptation is a holiday blessing,"The splendid production of ', 'A Christmas Carol', ' starring Jefferson Mays in a solo tour de force gets off with a bang. Suffice it to say that a rousing theatrical effect does its job.', 'It grabs you by the lapels — actually, the eardrums — and commands your complete attention. This show and the actor playing some 50 roles deserve it.', 'Drawn from Charles Dickens’s 1843 classic about transformation, redemption, and the Christmas spirit (in every sense), the adaptation by Mays, Susan Lyons, and director and co-conceiver Michael Arden tells a familiar story. London miser Ebenezer Scrooge goes from signature greediness to goodwill thanks to visitations by ghosts on Christmas Eve. He’s all the better for it, and so are his employee Bob Cratchit and his family, especially frail Tiny Tim.', 'Odds are you know what’s coming in the next scene if not the next line – like Scrooge’s icy remark about his city’s neediest people and the pluses of decreasing the surplus population. Still, the show makes the time-worn classic feel as fresh and invigorating as a new fall of snow.', 'Reprising his star turn from a 2018 run of the show at the Geffen Theatre in Los Angeles, Mays is a one-man wonder. He plays everybody in the story, including a narrator who pops in and out, men, women, ghosts, kids, and stewed potatoes (yes, as in vegetables – while it sounds as nutty as a fruitcake, the moment works like a charm).', 'He has glinting eyes that can veer from endearing to creepy in an instant, a supple voice that jumps up an octave to play young Ebenezer Scrooge’s heartbroken lost love and back down to play his forgiving nephew, and nimble fingers that mischievously wag to summon rambunctious children.', 'My favorite moment: Mays embodies the ghost of Jacob Marley, Scrooge’s long-dead business partner, with just-from-the-grave, lock-jawed perfection. Other ghosts materialize via other forms of theatrical magic.', 'The 90-minute staging is packed with imagination and how-did-they-do-that surprises that get your mind buzzing with questions: Where did that staircase come from? How did Scrooge show up here when he was just over there? Do I hear murmuring in the theatre? Yes, thanks to sound designer Joshua D. Reid. Mentioning any more details would spoil the fun.', 'Conceived by Arden and Dane Laffrey, who designed the evocative set and costumes, this production is a celebration of storytelling. ', 'A Christmas Carol', ' revels in theatricality. It dives directly into this iconic tale’s pitch-black heart.', 'It’s no fluke that at times the only illumination is from a single flame. Like Scrooge, we’re meant to grope our way through the shadows before coming out on the other side. As a result, the final scene, lit by Ben Stanton, is all the more transcendent.', 'It’s easy to get a little humbug: Another holiday season, another take on ', 'A Christmas Carol', '.

So long, Verona and stifling parents keen on locking her up in a nunnery. Freedom awaits! Juliet (the terrific Lorna Courtney), now 22 in the revised tale, considers life on her own terms.', 'She makes a beeline for Paris with her nurse (Melanie La Barrie, reprising her role from the show’s London premiere), a new non-binary BFF May (Justin David Sullivan), and another pal, April – who is actually Anne. She and Shakespeare write themselves into the revision; he’s a carriage driver. Along the way, some 30 hits from the Max Martin catalog, including “...Baby One More Time,” “Roar,” and “Since U Been Gone,” knit the narrative together.', 'This setup happens with surprising speed and economy. The early zippy energy is a big plus. Vibrant visuals are another. Director Luke Sheppard’s staging makes great use of projections, flying set pieces, and a levitating circular platform to showcase dramatic moments and athletic dance moves by choreographer Jennifer Weber.', ""There's plenty of drama in France after Juliet and company meet Francois DuBois (Philippe Arroyo), who’s looking for love, and his stern father Lance (Tony winner Paulo Szot, game but frequently upstaged by his codpiece), who shares a secret history with Juliet’s nurse."", 'Thanks to Will’s desire to stir the plot, dim Romeo (Daniel Maldonado, in for Ben Jackson Walker at a recent performance) pops up.

Costume designer Paloma Young pairs corsets, ruffs, and doublets with chunky boots and high-tops. There’s also a shoehorn lurking in the wings. As in any jukebox musical, some tunes are wedged in, but others fit surprisingly well.', '“I Want It That Way” becomes a useful all-purpose expression of desire, while “Oops! … I Did It Again” neatly covers romantic missteps. “Stronger” lets Juliet’s defiance toll. Romeo and Juliet’s conflicted feelings churn into a raucous “Problem/Can’t Feel My Face.”', 'Schitt’s Creek', ' writer David West Read penned the story, and it’s a mixed bag.

Creative license abounds, of course, but the script breezes over the fact that if Romeo is alive, then Juliet is still married. That puts a kink in major plot developments.

'The Kite Runner' review — stage adaptation of bestselling book is faithful to a fault,"In ', 'The Kite Runner', "", kite flying factors in two pivotal scenes. In the first, the actors come out waving gauzy white fabric hanging from springy wire rods, giving the illusion of kites flying in the air. At my performance, one of the kites failed to sufficiently lift off above the actor's head. It hovered slightly, then dipped toward the ground. The actor valiantly tried to pull it up, but the kite refused to take flight, seemingly comfortable bobbing along at shoulder height. This can be a metaphor for the play, which tries to soar beyond its origins as a novel, but remains steadfastly bound by its source material."", 'The Kite Runner', "" is based on Khaled Hosseini's bestselling 2003 novel of the same name. It is set in Afghanistan and is about two friends, Amir (Amir Arison) and Hassan (Eric Sirakian). The two are born only a year apart but have vastly different lives: Amir is rich and educated, Hassan is poor and illiterate; Amir is the master, Hassan is the servant; Amir is Pashtun, the dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan, while Hassan is Hazara, the minority group. Despite their differences, the two are best friends. But when Hassan is raped by a group of Pashtun boys, Amir chooses to runs away instead of helping his friend. That guilt, and his eventual redemption, makes up the bulk of the play and the novel."", 'In adapting the story, Matthew Spangler turns ', 'The Kite Runner', ' into a memory play: Amir as an adult tells his story to us, the audience, as a flashback. Director Giles Croft (who has directed ', 'The Kite Runner', "" in London) has Arison play Amir as a boy and an adult, which means Arison never leaves the stage throughout the play's 2.5-hour running time. Fortunately, Arison is magnetic as Amir, his lanky frame and everyman energy making him an inherently sympathetic narrator (even when Amir does the unforgivable). Arison's voice is deep and rich; you hang onto his every word."", ""In a novel, you need such a narrator to help you visualize a story from start to finish. The theatre has additional tools: actors, sets, music. Not everything in a play needs to be verbally described to the audience. But instead of utilizing those stage elements, Spangler and Croft overly rely on Hosseini's words. The play doesn't give"", 'The Kite Runner', ' new dimensions, as an adaptation should. Instead, it feels like a CliffsNotes version of the novel.', ""The play tells the audience what is happening instead of showing it. In a pivotal kite flying scene, there are no kites onstage. Instead, Arison stands in a kite-flying stance, snapping his body back and forth while describing what is happening. In the background, the ensemble provides swooshing sound effects. By not letting the audience see the kite competition, the narration robs the scene of dramatic tension and an opportunity for dynamic visual storytelling. Instead of being shown the splendor of dozens of kites in the air, battling for dominance, we're told about it. It's a missed opportunity when the only real kite in the play is being sold in the gift shop."", ""Adaptations can also improve upon the source material. In the original novel, Hassan is less of a fully developed human than a sacrificial lamb that needs to be slaughtered for Amir's personal development. Sirakian, with his round face and bright eyes, is heartbreaking as the innocent Hassan. But he is not given much to do beyond being uncomplicatedly good. Any potential dimension has been cut away. In "", 'The Kite Runner', ' novel, after Hassan is raped, Amir describes not seeing him for a week, with Hassan's father, Ali, saying, ""Lately, it seems all he wants to do is sleep. He does his chores, but then he just wants to crawl under his blanket."" The play cuts that line during an exchange between Ali (Evan Zes) and Amir. So even when Hassan is in pain, that pain is not given space to breathe, and the audience is not invited to sit with that loss of innocence. Instead the stage is immediately filled with more words, more narration, more plot.', 'Compared with the surfeit of words, ', 'The Kite Runner', ' has a very sparse set: A cityscape backdrop, some hanging curtains for projections, and sloped walkways on either side of the stage that make it look like the play takes place in a skate park instead of Afghanistan.

The production also manages to find humor in Hosseini's prose. When Arison says, ""Hassan's mother suffered a fate most Afghans consider far worse than death,"" he gives a well-placed pause before saying, ""She ran off with a troupe of actors and musicians.""', 'Toward the end of the play, Amir kneels down in prayer, his arms out and hands outstretched, repeating in Arabic: ""There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger.""

The cast have genuine comic chemistry with each other, and the audience around me guffawed in particular at Dratch's antics. Thanks to Linda Cho's costumes, I heard the loudest audience laugh this season over a piece of clothing: the high-heeled Crocs worn by Williams, who should be nominated for a Tony Award for how well she pulls them off."", ""Stroman, a master of moving multiple bodies around a room, manages to keep up the zany energy without dissolving into unintelligible chaos — the scenes that feature all the women are truly the highlights of the show, with every woman given room to take up space while keeping the main tension of the scene intact. The personalities on display here are so loud that it's a feat they don't overwhelm each other. Instead, they complement each other. The calm energy of Williams, Cooper, Hough, and Nakamura perfectly pairs with the manic energy of White, Dratch, and DeLaria."", 'Throughout the play, there's a familiar refrain, spoken about different women: ""Why isn't she president?"" It's truly the eternal question. And after the last presidency, which inspired ', 'POTUS', "", we need to have a laugh, even if it's a bitter one, about how the patriarchy is a rotting zombie that refuses to die. But while "", 'POTUS', ' starts off on a provocative note (the first word in the show is ""cunt"") and is pleasurably chaotic in its first act, the play loses steam during the second, and ultimately cannot decide what kind of play it wants to be.', 'Fillinger told ', 'The New York Times', ' that the play was inspired by the women who helped support the Trump Administration. Someone should tell Stroman and the cast.', 'POTUS', "" wants to have it both ways: It wants you to sympathize with the women supporting this terrible man in the White House and cheer them on as they learn to empower themselves, but it doesn't interrogate what kind of women would put aside their morals to support a man who has no problem grabbing women by the pussy. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Melania Trump were women working in the White House, but no one would look to them as a bastion of moral fortitude. They don't really care, so why should we?"", 'And it's not clear, besides the fact that these women are a diverse group, why the audience should be cheering for them. These women talk in bro speak (""get off my dick""). William's Margaret has abandoned her community to chase white supremacy (which Cooper's Chris calls her out on in one scene that has no follow-through or deeper exploration). There's also group encouragement when Hough's Dusty offers to give blowjobs to the Secret Service and goes through with it. A woman prostituting herself on behalf of other women doesn't make it more empowering. You cannot girlboss your way out of the patriarchy; you're just reaffirming its toxic practices.', 'Ultimately, ', 'POTUS', "" goes for an easy ending by teasing the audience with the possibility of a female president and female retribution.

That’s the point — that’s the cost of living.', 'The action unspools over nine scenes, and Wilson Chin’s spare, revolving set provides a smooth and seamless showcase in this Manhattan Theatre Club production.

Teeth… You’d keep me handsome.” She gets the gig. She’s desperate for money for reasons that emerge.', 'The story transitions to the rundown home of Ani (Katy Sullivan), Eddie’s estranged wife. A catastrophic accident shattered her spinal cord and left her a quadriplegic above-the-knee amputee. She’s bitter, and rightly so, with a salty tongue and no time for self-pity.

In back-to-back scenes, Jess washes John as he strips, and she helps him into his shower. It’s an intimate arrangement, but it plays out with a sense of equal mutual respect — or so it seems.

He talks about playing the piano as a kid. “Twenty-almost-one years,” she says. “You never told me that.” In a moment of acute tenderness that reveals Majok’s sensitive and creative mind, Eddie plays Ani’s arm like a keyboard.

That is, on the surface: Multiple journeys deep into Willy's psyche, where he loses himself in falsified, idyllic memories and pushes away dark ones the second they creep up, reveal his swagger to be a defense mechanism from the truth. Eventually, that defense gets tiring, and he can't fight for, or against, himself anymore. Pierceis a larger man, but he figuratively shrinks so much as the play goes on, one would swear the transformation was physical. When his wife Linda says of him, ""A small man can be just as exhausted as a great man,"" it's still believable as an assessment of his standing in the world.', ""Equally compelling are Khris Davis and McKinley Belcher III as Willy's sons Biff and Happy, each a warped mirror of their father. Biff, the elder son, shares his father's inability to truly succeed, in part because Willy raised him to pursue business when his passion lie in farming, and in part due to a grudge Biff holds against his father. He also inherited his father's temper, suggesting he could someday push his family away like Willy did. Happy, conversely, inherited his father's interest in business, if not his work ethic, and his final moment implies he'll follow his father's glorification of the American Dream.

It’s easy to see – and hear – that here. Over the course of 2 3/4 hours, bits of boogie-woogie, spirituals, and chants toll. Some lines are said so often they ring like refrains. History also looms large in Wilson's works, and that’s true of this 1990 Pulitzer Prize-winning chapter in his decade-by-decade deep dive into Black lives in the 20th century."", 'The setting is 1936 in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, where self-sufficient single mom Berniece Charles (Danielle Brooks) and her young daughter Maretha (Jurnee Swan) live with her uncle Doaker (Samuel L. Jackson). It’s a modest home – well-kept, nothing fancy. Except for one furnishing: an extravagantly carved upright piano that stands in full view in the living room. It has 88 keys and holds painful history.', 'The ornate instrument becomes the source of conflict when Berniece’s impetuous brother Boy Willie (John David Washington) arrives from Mississippi with his pal Lymon (Ray Fisher) and a truckload of watermelons. Boy Willie plans to sell the fruit and the piano in order to buy a stretch of land of his own.', 'But anyone who knows Berniece is aware that she won’t part with the piano – no way, no how. “You can’t sell your soul for money,” she tells her brother. He already knows where she stands, like everybody else, including Wining Boy (Michael Potts), Doaker’s brother; and Avery, (Trai Byers), the preacher Berniece has dated since her husband died. The piano is carved with images of enslaved ancestors and is a reminder of what the siblings’ father endured to get it.', 'Besides the piano, the past bleeds into the present in another way. The ghost of Sutter, a white man whose ancestors enslaved the Charleses, haunts the house. Berniece asks Avery to bless the residence to get rid of the spirit, but finally comes to realize that tapping into with her family’s past, not shunning it, is what it takes for an exorcism.', 'The cast is uniformly wonderful. The three leads blend and harmonize, while adding individual grace notes. Brooks speaks volumes with just a glance, Washington adds spirited bluster, and Jackson’s distinct voice was made for Wilson’s words. I lost count of how many times Doaker deadpans, “Berniece ain’t gonna sell that piano” – but he made it fresh each time. (Jackson understudied Boy Willie in the 1990 Broadway run.)', 'In their supporting roles, Fisher makes dim Lymon lovable, while Potts radiates gleeful charisma. Watching Wining Boy sell Lymon an absurdly ill-fitting suit is like taking a whiff of theatrical laughing gas. As Grace, a wise-to-the-world woman Boy Willie and Lymon try to romance, April Matthis gives a lesson in how to make a big impact with a small role.', ""The production team also delivers.

He merely runs around the stage for multiple numbers, though he's endearing as he watches the world unfold with believable wonder. In contrast, the Vain Man (Antony Cesar, who later performs the aforementioned ending flight), given license to leap and dance with abandon, is the sole character that takes full advantage of the stage during his solo and earns the praise his character craves.

'Funny Girl' review — Beanie Feldstein-led revival is a comedy promise unfulfilled,"Theatregoers seeking thrills at the revival of ', 'Funny Girl', ' aren't kept waiting. The musical about the real-life comedian Fanny Brice, back on Broadway for the first time since its 1964 premiere, instantly delivers delights in its exhilarating overture.

And when all is said and sung, it's as good as it gets in this less-than-persuasive production directed by Michael Mayer, whose credits include the hit "", 'Spring Awakening', ' and the short-lived ', 'On a Clear Day You Can See Forever', '.', 'Inspired by Brice's life and times, the plot captures onstage highs and offstage lows for some yin-yang conflict. It's also an ugly duckling-style story of how Brice's singular comedic talents bested her unconventional looks — the song ""If a Girl Isn't Pretty"" speaks plainly to that — and let her rise through burlesque ranks to be a wisecracking wonder woman in the Ziegfeld Follies in the 1920s. Yes, that happened.', ""It's a star part that's as juicy as it is challenging. "", 'Beanie Feldstein', ', who made her Broadway debut as Minnie Fay in 2017 in ', 'Hello, Dolly!', "", takes the quantum leap into the role that puts her front and center for most of the show. It's the one that made Barbra Streisand a household name and voice — and won her an Oscar in the film version."", 'The story, written by Isobel Lennart and revised here by Harvey Fierstein, begins in the late 1920s and unfolds as a memory. Fanny, who's in a new show, awaits her huckster husband, Nick Arnstein (Ramin Karimloo), who's just out of prison. ""Who Are You Now?"" she muses in one of the meditative mood-setters in the luscious score by composer Jule Styne and lyricist Bob Merrill. The real question: Can, and should, this marriage be saved?', ""The action flashes back to a stage-struck adolescent Fanny and her tough but supportive saloon-keeper single mother (a dry and wry Jane Lynch), who knows her daughter faces steep odds in showbiz. Fanny's connection to performer Eddie Ryan (Jared Grimes, affable and twinkle-toed) sets her on the track to stardom. The express train to success gets rerouted thanks to romance with Arnstein. Can a woman have it all? Decades later, the question remains."", ""The bittersweet answer eventually emerges as the action moves through time and from one place to another. David Zinn's soaring cylindrical scenic pieces open and close to reveal various locales. Susan Hilferty's floral headdresses lend whimsy to showgirl getups, while Kevin Adams's lighting provides glow and shadow on cue. Ellenore Scott's choreography for production numbers delivers jolts of energy, while Ayodele Casel's tap choreography gives Grimes a showcase that feels right for Brice's benefactor."", 'As the no-good Nick, Karimloo cuts a dashing figure. Aside from some odd, occasionally halting phrasing, he makes the most of his duets with Fanny including ""I Want To Be Seen With You"" and ""You Are Woman, I Am Man."" ""Temporary Arrangement,"" added to beef up the role, emits a sort of man-on-the-lam vibe and feels slightly out of place. ', 'This show rises or falls on its Fanny. Feldstein is game and likable but monochromatic in her acting and singing. Consequently, her star turn never quite lifts off the stage. Between the performance and the presentation, even ""His Love Makes Me Beautiful,"" a cheeky Follies number in which Fanny pulls a fast one while playing a bride, leaves you jilted.', ""In the end, Broadway's new "", 'Funny Girl', "" feels like a musical comedy promise left unfulfilled.

The problem is he doesn't know how to complete the story. The further he dives, the more aware and eager each new iteration of himself becomes to sabotage the process."", ""Those interruptions manifest onstage as vicious thoughts who gleefully shred Usher's confidence.

Rather than pen an angry op-ed, with ', 'A Strange Loop', ', he uses devastating lampoons on popular culture and revolutionizes the conventions of musical theatre to make audiences investigate where their own loathing began.', 'In his meditative 11 o'clock number, ""Memory Song,"" Usher shepherds us through his own conversion into ""one lone Black gay boy I knew who chose to turn his back on the Lord."" In revealing a version of his own life story through Usher, Jackson tells us it does not have to be this way.

'The Skin of Our Teeth' review — showy revival puts style over substance,"The dinosaur earned its entrance applause. Thornton Wilder's play "", 'The Skin of Our Teeth', ', a fantastical tragicomedy about the end of the world, calls for a dinosaur and a woolly mammoth. Typical productions have actors donning animal costumes. But the new Broadway revival of ', 'The Skin of Our Teeth', ' goes full ', 'Jurassic Park', ' (with the budget to match), with a gigantic brontosaurus, puppeteered by three people, lumbering onto the stage. A one-person-controlled woolly mammoth follows closely behind. These formidable, playful puppets (designed by James Ortiz) inspired gasps of shock and delightful laughter in the audience the night I went. Unfortunately, the dinosaur comes in at the beginning of this three-hour production, and the play struggles in the wake of its long tail.', 'At first glance, a revival of ', 'The Skin of Our Teeth', "" makes sense. The play isan allegory about an American nuclear family — the Antrobuses of Excelsior, New Jersey — going through multiple extinction-level events: an ice age, an Old Testament-style global flood, and a war. And through it all, the family stays together and survives — it's the end of the world as we know it, and the Antrobuses feel fine.Wilder wrote this three-act play in the years leading up to World War II (it premiered on Broadway in 1942 starring Tallulah Bankhead as the Antrobuses' hysterical, hilarious maid Sabina)."", 'Considering the multiple global crises we are collectively going through (climate change, a pandemic, threat of World War III), 2022 feels like the ideal time to revive ', 'The Skin of Our Teeth', "". And when Lileana Blain-Cruz was announced to direct in her Broadway debut, it seemed like an artistic no-brainer. Blain-Cruz is one of Off-Broadway's most in-demand directors for her remarkable ability to take ungainly, ideas-laden, experimental plays and find the beating heart at their center, while grabbing the audiences by the guts."", 'The Skin of Our Teeth', "" is one such play. It's filled with Brechtian fourth-wall breaks, characters from the Bible, and philosophical musings on the nature of existence. Blain-Cruz and Wilder, two different generations of experimental theatre artists, seem like the perfect marriage of work and artist. So it is truly surprising that here, the end of the world seems fairly routine."", 'Blain-Cruz has casted Black actors as the Antrobuses, making ', 'The Skin of Our Teeth', ' not just about the resilience of humanity, but particularly the resilience of the Black community. Roslyn Ruff (another experimental theater virtuoso) gives a well-modulated performance as Mrs. Antrobus. She is able to find the sensitive, maternal woman in the broadly drawn housewife archetype, and her comic timing and side-eye are razor-sharp.', 'The glory role in ', 'The Skin of Our Teeth', ' belongs to Gabby Beans as Sabina. Her eyes are wide in a state of perpetual surprise, and Beans starts off speaking in a voice I can only describe as campy Eartha Kitt. She then effortlessly modulates both her voice and mannerisms between the stylized Sabina and more realistic moments when she directly addresses the audience as an actress, such as when she remarks, ""I'll say the lines, but I won't think about the play. And I advise you not to think about the play, either."" Beans is so enjoyable to watch that when she leaves, you keep longing for her to come back.', 'Playwright Brandon Jacobs-Jenkins, who is also a wunderkind of messy plays that break the fourth wall, is credited as contributing ""additional material."" Those materials are mainly updates to the cultural references, such as a shoutout to August Wilson and a moving tribute in the third act to bell hooks. Watching ', 'The Skin of Our Teeth', "", I keep longing for Jacobs-Jenkins, one of the best playwrights of his generation, to make his Broadway debut in something that better showcases what he's capable of."", 'While this ', 'Skin of Our Teeth', ' is sumptuously presented, with three massive sets by Adam Rigg (including an entirely gratuitous but attention-pulling carnival slide in Act II), the spectacle also serves as a crutch and distracts from the urgency in the text. In Act II, set in Atlantic City, Broadway legend Priscilla Lopez plays the Fortune Teller. Her voice is amplified and warped as if she's the voice of God. But the amplification has the unfortunate effect of obscuring what she is actually saying. When the Antrobuses scramble onto a boat as the flood is coming, Lopez shouts, ""Start a new world. Begin again."" But her words are swallowed up by the chaos around her, and the effect is lost. Even as the alarms sound, the racially diverse ensemble is still dancing, making the message even more muddled. Is the audience supposed to be afraid for them? Or comforted that at least they're meeting their end in style? It's chaos with no coherence.', ""For a play about the end of the world, there's also a surprising lack of tension here. "", 'The Skin of Our Teeth', "" shouldn't just feel like the apocalypse; it should also feel like a theatre troupe putting a play together that keeps going haywire, where a strong wind could knock the production off its axis at any moment. And like their characters, the actors must persevere by, well, the skin of their teeth. But in Act One, when the walls of Antrobus's home are meant to crash around them, the set is just lifted cleanly in half. It reads less as things falling apart and more as a planned scene transition. The ground never feels off-kilter; it's too solidly constructed."", 'The Skin of Our Teeth', ' seems to find its footing in Act III, in a quiet moment free from distraction, when Mr. Antrobus (James Vincent Meredith, who struggles with Wilder's stylized dialogue) says to his wife, ""Maggie, we've come a long ways.

'for colored girls' review — individual colors don't make a cohesive rainbow,"Ntozake Shange's powerful paean to Black women, "", 'for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf', ', returns to Broadway in a bold revival that burns intensely, though with little nuance. As directed and choreographed by the much-lauded dancemaker Camille A. Brown, this production places an exclamation point at the end of its title, as if to claim that it will punch through every moment of grief until all that is left is celebratory victory.', ""While that approach serves as a pleasant corrective to Lea C. Gardner's gloom-laden interpretation of the work ― which played at "", 'The Public Theater', ' in 2019, with Brown as choreographer ― it does not create much of a throughline between the numerous arias assigned to ', 'for colored girls', ""'s characters. Nor does it deepen the meaning of the text. Instead, audiences are presented beautiful pictures and intense moments that smolder in isolation."", 'In composing ', 'for colored girls', ', Shange borrowed from African griot traditions to craft a new form of epic storytelling: the choreopoem, a fusion of poetry, dance, music, and song that transcends plot. The choreopoem instead focuses on establishing emotional rapport with audiences through the lyricism of Black language and customs as Shange experienced them. In ', 'for colored girls', ', Black women are represented by different colors, such as Lady in Blue (Stacey Sargeant, delightful) or Lady in Brown (Tendayi Kuumba, a lioness), and given rhapsodic poems that plumb every hue.', 'Rather than rely on words alone, Shange mandated that the unconquerable spirit of Black womanhood take flight through movement and music in addition to text. Brown, who has created her own resounding choreopoems ― most notably ', 'BLACK GIRL: Linguistic Play', ' and ', 'Mr. TOL E. RAncE', ' ― has not yet woven those elements into a cohesive whole. Rather, she delineates as if she were directing a traditional Broadway musical, or even a revue.', 'When the women dance, it often feels as if they are staking their claim to the entire universe. While that image is satisfying, it does not engage with what the text tells us: besides strong, Black women are also soft, vulnerable, confusing, inquisitive, and impossible to nail down. In presenting her cast as consummate warriors, Brown limits the range of what they can convey.', 'This is most clear with Lady in Yellow (D. Woods), who dives wholeheartedly into the exuberance of a young Black woman exploring her sexual agency. Yellow is often seen as the color of friendship, but it also deepens into royal gold. True to initial form, Woods strikes all the highlights of fun inquisitiveness and excitement that we associate with a young women enraptured by her own sexual power, but she stops short of commanding newer territory. Instead, she presents a collection of poses that lose meaning with every repetition.', ""Similarly, and through no fault of her own, Lady in Purple's (Alexandria Wailes) voice is also left unfulfilled. Indeed, her right to tell her own story is stolen by the decision to have Lady in Orange (Amara Granderson) speak for her. Wailes, who is deaf, signs beautifully, and with greater distinction than Granderson is able to convey. But even if Granderson had a better handle of her text, Brown is more than capable of transliterating Shange's aria for Wailes into brilliant movement language. Depriving Wailes of the opportunity to speak solely for herself is disappointing."", 'However, ', 'for colored girls', ' frequently soars, particularly when its performers meet the moments that Brown is trying to convey. Lady in Green, Okwui Okpokwasili (in a brilliant Broadway debut) shows us what might have been as she calmly swaggers through the fantastic ""Somebody Almost Run Off With Alla My Stuff."" Here she shows us that green is not only the color of envy, but also earthy dominion as she takes the full measure of someone who tries to own her without really understanding the immensity of her being: ""If it's really my stuff you got, you got to give it to me. If you want it, I am the only one that can handle it."" As Green, Okpokwasili gathers the entire production together.', ""There is much to say about Brown's bold directorial choices ― including the decision to cast a heavily pregnant Kenita R. Miller as Lady in Red without tying that pregnancy to Red's poem about a women whose children are murdered by their father ― and the failure of the cast to render them effectively. That is the tragedy of this production: Brown has arranged many glorious moments, but their potential remains unfulfilled."", 'I wish that I was reviewing a', 'for colored girls', "" with different costumes from Sarafina Bush's guerilla-warfare garb, more sensitive lighting than Jiyoun Chang's punchy pulses, and fewer of Aaron Rhyne's "", 'Reading Rainbow', ""-evoking projections.

The play, which first premiered in London in 2015 ahead of a sold-out Off-Broadway run in 2018, attempts to battle with, and justify, the abolition of death by hanging in 1965 England with hoots, cackles, and pints of beer. Lots of it. Consequently, the convicted criminal hanged moments after the play begins becomes the laughingstock of 45th Street. (The grammatical difference between ""hung"" and ""hanged"" is also a frequent source of comedy.)', ""It's hard to grapple with a noose being used as a foolish comedic prop. A rope used for centuries to dehumanize and murder Black bodies and executing (many innocent) convicts doesn't sit well when repurposed as humor. Far too many Black people have been unjustly convicted of crimes they didn't commit, and the sight of a noose alone comes with the remembrance of horrific acts of hate and violence. "", 'Hangmen', ""'s opening scene can be quite triggering. The prisoner pleading his innocence moments before being hung as a visual to shape this story doesn't help this argument.

"", ""After Harry performs his final duties as a state-sanctioned murderer, the audience's eyes descend on a pub he owns post-retirement, two years later.

Every one of Bobbie's friends offers a forecastof what her life could be outside of her chosen singleness (happy marriage, divorce, children, or all of the above); however, Bobbie never truly connects with anything past her own emptiness and self-inflicted loneliness. With every note she sings, the feeling inside the melodies of ""Marry Me a Little"" and ""Being Alive,"" arguably two of Sondheim's greatest songs, tend to evaporate like the uninterested men she attracts.', 'The dreamlike set design by Bunny Christie, when working, beautifully plays on the coming-of-age search for self, inspired by the childlikeness of ', 'Alice In Wonderland', "".

That cloudy thought pops up regularly during ', 'Flying Over Sunset', ', the movie-star handsome but exasperating Lincoln Center musical that imagines celebrated writer Aldous Huxley, actor Cary Grant, and author Clare Boothe Luce uniting to drop acid together in the 1950s. Sure, it's original, but that goes just so far. Waiting for an insightful takeaway is akin to sitting on the tarmac for 2 3/4hours only to be deplaned. The trippy spectacle of an LSD-high Grant singing, ""I am a giant penis rocket ship! Zoom! Kaboom!"" —yes, really —can't keep this from being a trek to nowhere.', ""It's dispiriting considering the proven potency of the creative team. Writer and director James Lapine's sensitivity and perceptiveness have shown through in "", 'Sunday in the Park with George', "". Composer Tom Kitt's music gave "", 'Next to Normal', "" its pulse. Lyricist Michael Korie's work in "", 'Grey Gardens', ' is as evocative as it comes. That was then. This is now.', ""The production is a head-scratcher from the get-go as the ensemble parades single file, doing loop-de-loops around the stage. Footsteps are loudly amplified, presumably to suggest the heightened sensory impact of LSD, but who knows. What's clear is that the actors go in circles and so does the show. The second half restates what's already been said in the first act, but with splashier visual effects. Songs drift in and out, etching vaporous impressions while they're at it. The pretty title song emerges as the most vivid."", ""Three appealing leads make the most of what they've got, including "", 'Harry Hadden-Paton', ' (', 'My Fair Lady', '), who plays ', 'Brave New World', 'author Huxley; ', 'Tony Yazbeck', ' (', 'On the Town', ') as film icon Grant; and ', 'Carmen Cusack', ' (', 'Bright Star', ') as playwright and ambassador Luce. A quick Google search reveals that the late celebrated figures individually experimented with LSD.', ""In a drugstore, alongside his ailing wife Maria (Laura Shoop) and gay friend Gerald Heard (Robert Sella), who's essentially an LSD docent, Huxley turns on and sees visions from a beloved Botticelli painting. Grant, reeling from a shaky marriage, experiments with the hallucinogen at a therapist's office and encounters his dad (Nehal Joshi) and his troubled young self Archie Leach (Atticus Ware). At her home, Luce takes a dose and envisions her daughter (Kanisha Marie Feliciano) and mom (Michele Ragusa), who each died in car wrecks."", 'Not long before intermission, they all meet at the Brown Derby restaurant, where the topic of LSD drops into the conversation. Luce asks, ""Wouldn't it be interesting if we three did this together with Gerald as our guide?"" Actually, not so much, as dreamed up in Act II in Malibu. Sexy Sophia Loren dances into Grant's mind, while Huxley is fixed on Maria. Luce's vision of her daughter presents itself like horror, while her mother's fate plays like a weird joke. In the end, the value of human connection is appraised.', ""The show's real star is its elaborate production. Toni Leslie-James's costumes are mid-century mouthwatering. Beowulf Boritt's sets, glamorously lit by Bradley King, summon a drugstore, airy homes, a shrink's office, and a Malibu beach, and are crisp and beautiful.

The book by two-time Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Lynn Nottage narrows in on Jackson's Dangerous Tour rehearsals in 1992 — well before allegations of child molestation charges against Jackson arose. With the Jackson estate on the production team, Nottage has fixed this musical's lens on the stories the artist told through his music. Jackson's troubled childhood, pain, and loneliness fueled creativity and inspired the lyrics he wrote."", 'Nottage's brilliant book gives the character of Jackson depth, and Myles Frost (who plays the eldest of three MJs who share the role) embodies the musician's complex persona. With every ""hee-hee"" and pelvic thrust, one can almost forget they're not seeing the King of Pop before their eyes. It's not easy to sing a Jackson song or move with the late star's precision, flexibility, and finesse. Many ', 'American Idol', "" auditions have proven this true. But here, Frost has immersed himself into the spirit of Michael Jackson, producing distinct parallels to the icon's childlike behavior, restlessness, and paranoia."", ""Frost gives this show not only his divine voice, but also a nuanced performance that humanizes the flawed superstar. In fact, all three generations of MJ exceed expectations.

The smooth and swift changes between a man Jackson fears and a man he trusts give scene transitions delicate density."", 'Musical numbers like ""They Don't Really Care About Us,"" ""Human Nature,"" ""Stranger in Moscow,"" and ""Thriller"" are the show's highlight reels.

The dance ensemble delivers paramount performances that leave an imprint on the memory. This team is a true tour-de-force.', ""In the audience, some longtime fans sang along and cried, others who never experienced Jackson live remained mesmerized, and even a few skeptics cheered thunderously.

'Skeleton Crew' review — a moving portrait of the true essential workers of America,"You might think a play set in a factory would be dank and depressing. But when you have Dominique Morisseau as the playwright, the factory doesn't just come alive; it literally dances."", ""Morisseau's play "", 'Skeleton Crew', "" is set in a car parts factory. And instead of showing the whirring and grinding of an assembly line, Morisseau does something more ingenious: She has a dancer (a dynamic Adesola Osakalumi) pop and lock to a soundtrack of machinery.

The factory workers have been there for years, some decades, and the play takes time to show the familial bond between them. The matriarch is Faye ("", 'Phylicia Rashad', ""), the most senior of the bunch, who has worked on the line for 29 years. The older brother figure is Reggie (Brandon J. Dirden), who used to work on the line and is now a supervisor. Then there's the younger ones: Dez (Joshua Boone) and Shanita (Chanté Adams), whose will-they-won't-they flirtations give the play its moments of much-needed levity."", ""Conflict arrives when Reggie tells Faye that the plant is about to shut down.

Most viewers might associate Rashad with a more refined sensibility. Yet Rashad has transformed herself into the grittier Faye. Her voice is more gruff. Even down to the way the character walks, slightly bent over and in a shuffle, as if she's carrying a heavy load on her back.', ""Rashad herself also carries a warm, maternal energy. This helps the audience to understand why Faye would care more about how the closures affect the younger people around her than herself. And why she is so prideful that she doesn't disclose her old difficult circumstances to anyone."", ""As Reggie, Dirden plays a man torn between the white-collar promise of the bosses upstairs and his loyalty to the crew he came from. It's difficult initially to trust Reggie — he is management, after all. But Dirden has a natural charisma that just begs for your sympathy (who can say no to that melodic voice?). When he is finally given a monologue in the second act, in front of Rashad's Faye, Dirden makes a meal of it. The two of them together in one scene is an acting masterclass.

"‘Lackawanna Blues’ review – Ruben Santiago-Hudson delivers an explosive, unmissable performance","Setting off fireworks may be illegal in Broadway theatres, but Ruben Santiago-Hudson unleashes them continually in the Manhattan Theatre Club production at the ', 'Samuel J. Friedman Theatre', ', as he seamlessly transforms into 24 individuals from his childhood as a ward in a rooming house in Lackawanna, New York ― all this while meticulously embodying their every hope and disaster.', ""Each character in the play is sensational and original, but the show's heartbeat resides in the pillar of the community: Ms. Rachel Crosby, AKA Nanny, a matronly Black woman from the South who knows how to throw down more ferociously than any battle-hardened boxer or grifter. But Nanny chooses to devote her strengths to lifting up her beautiful Black people at a time when the world insisted that they belonged in the gutter."", 'In ', 'Lackawanna Blues', ', Santiago-Hudson tells her story as the de facto mother of a crew of wily characters from all over the United States, whom she keeps together whenever they get underfoot. Some came to her boarding house after fleeing tragedy or the law; others, such as Young Ruben, AKA Junior, were recruited after Nanny saw that they were in need. All blossom under her nurturing gaze, even if that means coaxing them to drop their fisticuffs with a freshly cooked meal or threatening them into behaving properly with a chilling smile that brooks no dissension.', 'Hudson-Santiago penned and performed the play 20 years ago at The Public Theatre, and for the Broadway debut, he has taken over directing duties as well. The near autobiographical piece is well-crafted, but like many one-person performances, its constant focus on the past threatens to descend into maudlin reveries at times. What keeps the story fresh is not only the authenticity that Ruben-Santiago has invested into each characterization ― from their bodily tics to their ultra-specific regional accents ― but also the incisive attack that he takes in pushing the action forward.', ""Rather than mock the people from his past, Hudson-Santiago takes their flaws seriously and treats them like the main characters of the overall drama. Whether they be an autistic man menacingly searching for his jingly keys or a man whose tongue darts like a serpent's between each word he takes or an eager party girl using her gyrating rump to lure in a mate, the play and actor revel in their humanity while avoiding caricature for the sake of cheap laughs. Their opportunities may have been scarce, but regardless of their circumstances, "", 'Lackawanna Blues', ' refuses to treat its characters like props; rather the play honors them for no other reason than they are alive.', 'Given the wealth of details that Hudson-Santiago unfurls, the overall experience could be exhausting. What prevents the audience from drowning is the conversational tone that he takes while inviting us into his world; the camaraderie that he establishes with his onstage companion and backing guitarist ― a fabulous Junior Mack ― and the constant return to Nanny. Whenever Ruben-Santiago brings his hands together and calmly transforms into her, she becomes our northern star. That action is an essential reminder that the Black women have always been the source of survival for the Black community within the United States.

"", ""As embodied in knockout performances by the production's virtuosic stars — Simon Russell Beale, Adam Godley, and Adrian Lester — three generations of the eponymous brothers and their accomplices are rendered in extraordinary human detail.

'Thoughts of a Colored Man' review - timely new play shows the universe in Black men,"Shakespeare once wrote, ""What a piece of work is a man!"" In that famous monologue from Hamlet, Shakespeare was writing about, in part, the varied beauty and contradictions within humanity. Granted, Shakespeare was talking about white men, who for centuries have been given the gift of being seen as fully formed human beings. Unfortunately, while this benefit was extended to white men, it has not been extended to Black men. That sense of humanity, virtues, and flaws in Black men is what Keenan Scott II's powerful new Broadway play, ', 'Thoughts of a Colored Man', ' aims to portray.', 'Thoughts of a Colored Man', "" follows seven different Black men as they go through their day in Brooklyn. These men may live in the same neighborhood but they each have individually compelling stories. There's Depression who had to defer his dreams in order to take care of his struggling family; there's Passion who was raised without a father and in need of guidance as he's about to become one; there's Happiness who is gay and well-to-do and trying to find community."", 'The other men are similarly named with different emotions (Wisdom, Love, Anger, Passion). What Scott and the cast skillfully portray is how each man is fully formed and contains multitudes: both tough and vulnerable, fearful of love yet deeply craving it.', 'Scott wrote ', 'Thoughts of a Colored Ma', 'n as a response to the stereotypical ways that Black men are portrayed in the wider culture. So, in the play, every man has the space to convey his own thoughts to the audience, while also interacting with his fellow man. The set (by Robert Brill) is simple: a billboard with the word ""colored"" on it in all caps. Every time a scene changes, the billboard changes to a different projection (Sven Ortel), and the sound design (Mikaal Sulaiman) and lighting (Ryan O'Gara) give the audience a new sense of place. The design gives the play a mosaic quality: These individual monologues and dialogues add up to a whole portrait, one of the universal humanity within Black men.', ""A scene in the barbershop with all seven men conveys Scott's ability to write for different types of voices: the dialogue crackles and swerves, personalities and conflicts, and probing questions about gentrification and poverty are brought up. The production is also buoyed by the chemistry of the cast, and the different energies they each bring to their characters. One thing is made perfectly clear: the Black community, and Black men especially, are not a monolith."", 'Thoughts of a Colored Man', "" borrows aspects of Ntozake Shange's For colored girls...., which was an expansive portrait of Black women. Both plays have similar allegorical naming conventions for its character and they are also performed in verse. "", 'Thoughts of a Colored Man', ' uses slam poetry, spoken word, and song.

'Trouble in Mind' review — the kind of good trouble Broadway needs,"I once asked a famed Tony-winning Broadway director, what is the point of a revival? Is it to tell us how far we've come or to tell us how far we have to go? The answer that the director gave me was a simple yes. If the same question was asked about the glorious revival, and belated Broadway debut, of Alice Childress's play "", 'Trouble in Mind', ',the answer would definitely be a resounding yes. Though the play was written in 1955, it pulsates with such vitality that it feels like it was written yesterday, showing the audience that while some things have changed in 66 years, others have stayed maddeningly the same.', ""In 1955, Childress's play "", 'Trouble in Mind', 'premiered off Broadway and was well-received critically. The play was optioned for Broadway with a caveat: Childress had to tone down her play about racism in the American theatreand make it more comfortable for the ostensibly white audience that would be seeing it. Childress refused, and ', 'Trouble in Mind', 'was relegated to the footnotes of American theatrehistory, never achieving the kind of mainstream success that it deserved. Until now, whenit has been given its much-delayed Broadway debut 66 years later.', ""Childress's contemporaries included Lorraine Hansberry and her play "", 'A Raisin in the Sun', '.While Hansberry's play dealt with the overt, capital-R racism of housing discrimination, Childress's dealt with a common, insidious form of racism, that of well-meaning liberals — those who Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called the white moderates, ""more devoted to 'order' than to justice.""', 'Trouble in Mind', ""is a workplace comedy, about a group of Black actors and two white actors gathering, in Arnulfo Maldonado's shabby chic set, to rehearse a new Broadway play about a lynching in the American South. The intentions are valid: to move the white audience into sympathizing with the Black experience. Except the play is written by a white playwright and overseen by a white director, and all of the Black characters are servants and stereotypes that only scrape and bow to their white employers."", 'Trouble in Mind', ""doesn't mention microaggressions but that is exactly what happens during this rehearsal process,such as how the white actress Judy (an authentically oblivious Danielle Campbell) never hangs up her own coat and always gives it to one of the Black actors, or when director Al Manners (played by Michael Zegen, at his most unlikeable) keeps on interrupting Black actress Wiletta (an electrifying "", 'LaChanze', "") when she's speaking."", 'The audience sees the actors rehearse the fictional play, pushed by the abusive Al to find the ""truth"" and motivations of their characters. Except the Black characters were written by a white man.

Randolph-Wright threads that needle finely;the audience are charmed by the actors and their interpersonal dynamics. Then when rehearsals start for the play-within-a-play, it is clear where the characters have had to compromise themselves, so moments when the Black actors have to play stereotypes, the discomfort is pronounced.', 'Trouble in Mind', 'runs at 2hours and 10 minutes, but once it gets going, Randolph-Wright keeps it moving briskly like a runaway train. And when the inevitable crash comes, it is breathtaking.', ""At the center of the play is LaChanze's Wiletta, who is tired of playing the maid and wants to be a legitimate actress. Dressed in Emilio Sosa's sumptuous period costumes, LaChanze's natural magnetism means that it is even more offensive when Wiletta is forced to be sidelined in the narrative. Wiletta's frustrations are a slow build but when she inevitably breaks into an earth-shattering monologue in the second act, it's not only earned, but necessary."", 'The rest of the characters are not as fully developed as Wiletta, which is a shame. But the cast is so dynamic that even when they are in the background, you want to look at them and take in the entire tableau — particularly Chuck Cooper and Jessica Frances Dukes, who are skilled at conveying depth, even contempt, in just looks and small actions.', 'Childress wrote ', 'Trouble in Mind', 'because of her frustrations at the lack of substantive roles for Black actors. Today, Black actors, and actors of color, are still trying to go beyond playing stereotypes on stage and on screen. Those same actors have come together to release the We See You, White American Theatre letter last year.

The onstage orchestra, raised at either side, swells the bayou setting with a rich and humid atmosphere."", 'Caroline's greatest sorrow, it turns out, is eventually losing her temper on a privileged boy who treats her like the family dog. Clarke knocks the musical's 11 o'clock number, ""Lot's Wife,"" absolutely past the Milky Way and into another plane of being. However stirring the lament, Caroline still had every right to put the little punk in his place.', ""It may be just as well to close your eyes, at least for a moment, as Clarke's performance outstrips the story, to imagine a world where Caroline can breathe — and do more than just count her coins — in peace."", 'Caroline, or Change runs at Studio 54 through January 9, 2022.

If I tell you the ""Secret"" now, it will spoil it for you. And, at the risk of being prescriptive, I declare that you should have this thrill in your life. This show magnifies the basic reason we go to the theatre: To willingly suspend our disbelief in a mysterious alternate universe that surrounds us every day. I promised Mr. Brown to not tell you what happens in this show. Before that, I promised to write this review.

This is not a 1930's Vaudeville medium show. The excitement is not reserved only for audience members chosen to directly participate. You can just hang back and Brown will entertain you - unless you are a lizard person - because inviting people onto the stage introduces the tension of tearing open the fabric of the show; and the thrill is seeing Brown turn those ripped seams into impossible demonstrations of controlled illusion. Okay, I kind of just told you that there is audience participation... and illusion. It may be okay that I told you that.

Review of What the Constitution Means to Me on Broadway,"Midway through ', 'What the Constitution Means to Me', ', the captivating history lesson cum family memoir that has moved to the', 'Hayes Theater', "" after a triumphant off-Broadway run, the show's writer and star, "", 'Heidi Schreck', ', makes one of her many seemingly unscripted comments.

It is at that point that Schreck drops any last pretence of being a character in a play, rather than the intimate confidant that the audience by then knows her to be. And if her achy jaws are a sign of just how clearly Schreck loves to perform this work, it is also a metaphor. Politeness with a forced smile, she implies, has been a very unsatisfactory substitute for rage against oppression, for her as well as for the women who came before her. If this show, told mostly in monologue, is an overt tutorial on one of America's founding documents, it is equally a master class in contemporary feminism.', 'The personal was political for Schreck from the age of 15 when, as she demonstrates, she raised money for college by participating in debates about the Constitution that were staged in American Legion halls around the country. She and her ""fiercest competitor,"" a girl named Becky Lee, would stand in front of groups of old white men, expounding on the genius of a document created by a group of old, white men, while being held to a strict time limit by a white man with a stopwatch (Here, played disarmingly by the fine ', 'Mike Iveson', ').

""I'm going to be 15, but I'm not going to do anything special to make myself 15,"" Schreck informs us from the start, and soon enough her debate jacket comes off and time becomes fluid. She climbs through her maternal family tree revealing multiple generations of women who persisted through physical attacks and chemical depression to arrive at a point where she and her relatives are ""mostly okay."" Schreck herself is quirky enough to still be emotionally attached to a stuffed animal yet self-aware enough to realize how problematic that can be for a middle-aged woman. Her writing is filled with smart, comic pivots and, as sharply directed by ', 'Oliver Butler', ', she underplays the cruel absurdity of old dudes in robes making decisions about her body to full, devastating effect.', ""The play's last scene shifts away from her story and embraces "", 'herstory', '. Schreck is joined on stage by an African-American high school girl (either ', 'Rosdely Ciprian', ' or ', 'Thursday Williams', ', depending on the night), and the two hold a formal Parliamentary debate over whether or not the Constitution should be abolished.

Waitress,"Waitress is a musical that will leave you fahklempt, because of Sarah Bareilles' sublime music, but seriously unsatisfied with the decision to overstuff this story."", 'There are a few basic and necessary ingredients in writing a story. On the one hand there is the three character rule. Two main characters, one of whom - the primary - is driving the piece (Romeo tumbles for Juliet), and a third character whose presence affects the plot. Romeo kills Mercutio and things go south. We see this all the time in every single show on TV. Every. Single. One. Then you have your actions: discover, deliberate and determine. Also in every TV script. These are basics that date back to a seriously long time ago. Way long. And they are basic because they work. They work so well that when you see a show that feels off you can go directly to these rules and see where the applecart tipped over.', 'In this case I picture this esteemed tribe of artists sitting around the worktable and considering what to cut. I saw this show in Boston and it was ripe for scissoring back then. I picture the conversation went something like, ""Well, we could cut the song about dating."" And the reply, ""Oh but I love that song. And she nails it."" ""OK. How about the one where she defends her love life."" ""Nope. We need that one because she's been silent up till then."" And on and on and on. In the end everything stayed because all the elements were too dear. No one had the laser vision to make the cuts. Even the song ""I Love You Like A Table"" - the title speaks for itself...', 'To use the pie analogy that begins the show, this team took sugar, butter, flour and added chocolate, cinnamon, lemons, ginger, molasses, minced meat and... you get the idea.', 'On the plus side of everything is Jesse Mueller whose skill at delivering a whole universe in a song is astonishing. Her range is stratospheric and her heart is in every note. As Jenna, she is the waitress who supplies Joe's Diner with pies that are not just pies. Each one is life. ""Deep Dish Blueberry Bacon"" ""Betrayed by My Eggs Pie"". Some are real, others are fantasy, like ""My Husband's A Jerk Chicken Pot Pie"".', 'Jenna is one of those women who never gets a leg up. The kind of woman who will not be able to afford a ticket to this show. She married because there was not much else to do. And now her husband has devolved into a self-pitying Neanderthal named Earl (Nick Cordero). At work Jenna is buoyed up by the other waitresses. Dawn (Kimiko Glenn) is a perky waif who would like to be in love but has no idea how to do it. Becky (Keala Settle) is a woman with a lot of mileage who still has plenty of tread on her tires. The cook Cal (Eric Anderson) is a monosyllabic soul of hidden substance. The owner Joe (a delightful as always Dakin Matthews) wears gruff like an impenetrable suit and misses nothing. His solo ""Take It From An Old Man"" left the audience moved so much we almost forgot to clap. Then there are the customers who dance and sing through life.', ""In other words there is nothing new here. Except for the arrival of the local gynecologist Dr. Pomatter (Drew Gehling) to whose office Jenna bolts when she learns she is pregnant with a child she does not want because a) it is Earl's and b) she is pretty certain she will mess up being a mother. The highly improbable relationship that develops between doctor and patient is made plausible, once again, because of the music. Their several duets are exquisite, and when it comes to being funny, Gehling walks away with the trophy."", 'Eventually Jenna gets her courage back, and the balcony erupts with applause. Not so much in the orchestra where I imagine there were a lot of women seeing themselves on that stage: in an unhappy relationship with future prospects looking dim.

The Phantom of the Opera,"Join me for a little jaunt down memory lane to a magical place that is alive and well. Andrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, directed by theatre legend Harold Prince and produced by Cameron Mackintosh and The Really Useful Group, is the longest-running show in Broadway history. A recent revisit to this lavish production got me to thinking about what it takes to make a show age so beautifully."", 'Well, you start with a story that reeks of sexuality, mystery, innocence and passion. Then you add music that weaves motif after motif together in a manner that even a tone deaf person could grasp. Add impeccable design - 19th century costumes and a set that is so enormous it dwarfs the cast and so spectacular that you can hardly keep track of where you are. Top it off with staging that is actor proof and voila!', ""When I say actor-proof, I don't mean that this cast is in any way deficient. Indeed, each is an impeccable performer. The three principals have spectacular voices that span several octaves, and each knows exactly how to deliver the goods. Julia Urdine as Christine is no shrinking violet. She is a young woman who opens her heart and her voice to whatever adventure the world offers, including the power and dark magic of the Phantom. Jeremy Hays (Raoul) has the difficult job of playing second romantic fiddle to the Phantom, and he manoeuvers up that river without flagging for an instant. James Barbour (the 15th Phantom on Broadway) is menacing and vulnerable, and his passion takes up the entire stage whenever he is on it. Watching him in person one realizes that singing with a mask and several layers of latex on your face is no easy feat. Barbour, however makes it look so."", 'The Phantom of the Opera, based on the classic novel by Gaston Leroux, is the story of a man who was born with a horribly deformed face. He hides in the bowels of a Paris opera house where he toys with and torments the occupants just because he can. When he hears Christine Daaé sing, however, his heart bursts open and he dedicates himself to nurturing her talent. Soon the Phantom is overtaken by his own passion for Christine as a woman and a singer, and he becomes reckless. He shows her his lair in the river below the city. He reveals his love for her. She responds in kind, until she sees his face. Still, their connection remains inviolable, even when Christine tumbles for Raoul. The Phantom makes demands on her behalf and declares war on the opera house when his demands are not met. Everything comes to a head, with Raoul becoming the pawn. The lovers are allowed to live and the Phantom - well, who knows what happened to him?', 'This story has it all: music that stays with you long after the curtain comes down (yes I bought the CD), love in an array of colors, fantasy, danger, sex, hopes and dreams. The Phantom of the Opera remains a stunning production that engages the ear, the eye and the heart. The fact that it has done so for nearly 30 years world wide is testament to the crafty craft of making theatre. Theatre is ultimately a magic show, and one of the reasons being human is such a gas.', 'Got a friend coming into town? Take her to see this one. You won't be disappointed one little bit. And when you buy the music I won't say, ""I told you so."" Promise.', '(Photo by Matthew Murphy)', '""It may be possible to have a terrible time at The Phantom of the Opera, but you'll have to work at it. Only a terminal prig would let the avalanche of pre-opening publicity poison his enjoyment of this show, which usually wants nothing more than to shower the audience with fantasy and fun, and which often succeeds, at any price. The physical production, Andrew Bridge's velvety lighting included, is a tour de force throughout—as extravagant of imagination as of budget.""', 'Frank Rich for New York Times', '""It is a spectacular entertainment, visually the most impressive of the British musicals. Perhaps the most old-fashioned thing about it is it's a love story, something Broadway has not seen for quite a while. To say the score is Lloyd Webber's best is not saying a great deal. His music always has a synthetic, borrowed quality to it. As you listen you find yourself wondering where you've heard it before. In this case you've heard a lot of it in Puccini, in the work of other Broadway composers and even the Beatles. Nevertheless he seems to be borrowing from better sources, and he has much greater sophistication about putting it all together. There are some droll opera parodies, several beautiful songs, an impressive septet and a grand choral number, all richly orchestrated.""', 'Howard Kissel for New York Daily News', '""Technically it is a piece of impeccably crafted musical theater, with theme, music and staging in perfect accord.

Dear Evan Hansen,"When my eyes are wet and it's all I can do to not join the dialogue on the stage and my giggle box has completely turned over, I am having a really really good time. This reviewer is not a huge fan of musicals by any means - too much distraction and not enough story in most cases - but "", 'Dear Evan Hansen', ' is a show that holds you tight with its honesty of story told in a way that delights you to your very toes.', 'Every aspect of what you see, hear and feel hums in perfect harmony throughout the piece. The songs, by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, are poetic expressions of real human stuff that dove tails perfectly with the storytelling. Nowhere to be found is that smile-and-move-your-hands song break that must be endured before we get back to the meat of the matter.', 'The shame of being human is never more tender than when one is in high school. Our hero, Evan Hansen (Ben Platt), is a sweet senior in high school who is socially challenged, prescription medicated, adored by his single mother, Heidi Hanson (Rachel Bay Jones), has a therapist and has a crush on a girl named Zoe Murphy (Laura Dreyfuss). We want Evan to win because he is just totes adorbs as he struggles to express himself, control his outbursts and fulfill expectations to complete the assignment his therapist gave him this week - to write an encouraging letter to himself every day. Platt is perfection as that kid you remember from your high school, whom you likely owe a huge apology, as he chokes on nearly every word before it bursts out of him loaded with the urgency only a teenager can assign to his own expression.', ""The unrequited Zoe's family is a mother, Cynthia Murphy (Jennifer Laura Thompson), father, Larry Murphy (Michael Park) and a brother, Connor Murphy (Mike Faist). Connor is also socially challenged and prone to outbursts. But Connor is self-medicated and at war with his parents who are at war with one another. Zoe does her best to avoid the cross-fire."", 'These mothers have something in common and the song ""Anybody Have A Map?"" can only bring the damp eyes of recognition to many of us also wishing our special needs kids came with manuals. I've met the mothers Jones and Thompson are and I've put on the masks they do to face the world and hide the complete lack of clue we have about our matriarchal responsibilities.', ""Connor and Evan have a run in between classes at school which is verbally hurtful and ends in Connor shoving Evan to the floor. Zoe tries to smooth things over in a scene saturated with teenage angst, misunderstanding and vulnerability, which is, of course, very funny. Dreyfuss is beautiful. Her voice and manner are the romantic poetry you remember from when you idealized young love. You will fall hard for her. Later, when it looks like the boys might mend, Connor finds one of Evan's letters on a printer in the lab at school. The letter describes Evan's hope for a future with Zoe. Connor, at first, thinks this is seriously creepy and then with the warp speed of a bored teen looking for a problem, Connor decides this is a ruse by Evan to upset him enough to stimulate another rage episode and make everyone else in school think Connor is crazy. Faist is flawless as he gives us the really hard to love boy teen narcissistic asshole who misdirects his passion against his own best interests. We know this kid, too. He's the one who didn't make it."", ""And this is only the beginning of the misunderstanding of Evan's letter to himself, which quickly becomes public - nay, let's modernize that; it goes viral. Writer, Steven Levenson, has given us a story that could be told around a dinner table right now. Social media is cast in the role of Monster Maker."", 'I cannot bear to give any more away as ', 'Dear Evan Hansen', ', in my opinion, is required viewing, but I do want to shout out a few more nuggets about the production before I leave you with orders to immediately purchase your tickets. Evan's friend-because-the-family-says-he's-a friend, Jared Kleinman (Will Roland), is a power house of comic expression charged with extreme mischief. Kleinman wrecked my kidneys with laughter. Connor's ""acquaintance,"" Alana Beck (Kristolyn Lloyd), is the poseur girl you knew in school. Lloyd exposes the loneliness of that girl causing you to, of all things, forgive her. The first dancing sequence, choreographed by Danny Mefford. between Jared, Connor and Evan is a total squeal; I wanted to see it again immediately. Thompson brilliantly portrays an irrationally hopeful mother so well that, even though we know she is deceived, we catch ourselves coming along with it. Platt's performance is beyond sublime - every reviewer will tell you this. But the added bonus is the stunningly beautiful work of Jones. The journey Heidi Hanson takes in this story is the most transformative of all the characters and Jones acts without a filter giving us every ugly and beautiful detail of her character's growth shamelessly.', 'The songs and dance in this show move the story forward - thank you, God - rather than stopping the action and causing you to look at your watch.

Miss Saigon,"Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg's Miss Saigon has taken its second helicopter ride across the Atlantic from London, and landed right back at the Broadway Theatre, where it first set down in 1991 under heavy enemy fire. The anti-aircraft artillery at that time came not from the Viet Cong, as would befit an epic musical set in the final days of the Vietnam War, but from Actors Equity and the Asian-American community, who objected to the casting of a white actor (Jonathan Pryce) in a Eurasian role. Cameron Mackintosh, the show's producer then and now, threatened at the time to abort the mission, but after coming to terms, he managed to land his imported mega-musical safely, with all hands on board, where it afterward hovered over Broadway for ten successful years. It also enjoyed a 10-year run at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London, and has been performed in 28 countries in 15 different languages, so the reason for its re-appearance right now isn't readily apparent. To heck with that pesky Immigration controversy that is now confronting the nation, the big chopper is back, blowing up dust in a ramped-up new production directed by the talented Laurence Connor. The casting of Jon Jon Briones, a Filipino chorus member of the original London production, as The Engineer, a role more or less made infamous by Jonathan Pryce, has quieted the casting issues, and in the title role that launched the amazing Lea Salonga's career, the young newcomer Eva Noblezada is simply sensational as Kim, the war-orphaned teenager who winds up working for The Engineer in his garish Saigon den of vice, Dreamland."", ""The story is loosely based on Puccini's 1904 opera Madama Butterfly, with the setting transposed to 1975 Saigon on the eve of the American evacuation from Vietnam. While the tragic love sequence in both remains identical (boy meets girl, boy loses girl, girl has little boy), dropping the action into the wild context of Saigon in the last days of the Vietnam War allows the show's creative team to swirl a cynical mist around the immigrant dream of coming to America, with a vision of the real American dream as something bloated and empty. From its viewpoint on the ground in Southeast Asia, America is depicted in Miss Saigon as the departing imperial force heedless of the collateral carnage it has left behind in its wake. The famous Act Two helicopter is an apt, if gaudy, symbol for that; the same could be said of the male protagonist, a young U.S. Marine, Chris (Alistair Brammer), who is forced to abandon his (even younger) Vietnamese sex-shop bride Kim without knowing what will become of her, or even that he has fathered a child with her. Like Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly, Chris later returns to Asia (with his wife) to reclaim his son, and just as in Butterfly, well, let's just say you won't need night-goggles to see the helipad coming."", 'Nevertheless, the story packs an unavoidable emotional punch, even if you do see it coming, largely due to the performance of Ms. Noblezada. She is so entirely connected to her character, to Kim's grit and resolve, and to her youthful love for Chris and for her son, that she carries you along with her, just as she carries the soaring ballads and anthems the score asks her to deliver throughout the show. She simply nails all of it, and there is little question that this new production of Miss Saigon has produced yet another bona-fide star. Jon Jon Briones is doubtless giving the best performance of his long career, and he seems to be enjoying every nanosecond of it. His performance is a creepy treat, from start to finish, chock-full of details and nuance, totally in control, even when things get out of control. He delivers the big production numbers with mad aplomb, especially the over-the-top eleven o'clock number, ""The American Dream,"" in which he competes for attention with the entrance of a gigantic Statue of Liberty, which regurgitates an enormous white vintage Cadillac that is even longer than the line at the ladies room at intermission.', ""The large cast is uniformly excellent, and given the epic scope of the production the efforts of the versatile ensemble are nothing short of Herculean. Alistair Brammer is a bit stiff physically, but he more than makes up for that with sincerity and an excellent singing voice, and stand-outs in the main supporting roles include a solid Nicholas Christopher (John) and Devin Ilaw (Thuy), who sets a very high bar, vocally, for the rest of the cast. The design elements are appropriately impressive, propelling the story along to its inevitable conclusion, with protean sets by Totie Driver and Matt Kinley, based on a design concept by Adrian Vaux; lights by Bruno Poet, and costumes by Andreane Neofitou. Bob Avian's musical staging, with additional choreography by Geoffrey Garratt, is seamless, in the commercial Broadway sense, inseparable from Mr. Connor's staging and masterful in its own right. The pop-rock score, by Claude-Michel Schonberg, is sometimes tepid and often repetitive, but when it has to soar it does so, usually on the wings of Eva Noblezada's beautiful soprano voice."", ""This production, while dated, is not without tooth, and at its best moments, usually in its big production numbers, it can still deliver plenty of bite. But the larger problem is that the world has changed since 1991; today's reality places Miss Saigon, with its lurid immigration nightmare of a crass, hollow American dream not really worth having, oddly out of context with a world in which millions of refugees are desperately seeking shelter in an America that is now officially seeking to ban them."", '(Photo by Matthew Murphy)', '""It's not as if such stories don't still have the power to stir suspense and tears. But this eventful, sung-through production out of London, directed by Laurence Connor, feels about as affecting as a historical diorama, albeit a lavishly appointed one.""', 'Ben Brantley for New York Times', '""This bracing new production from London reminds that whirlybirds can't whip up emotions. Only good actors can do that. The revival of the musical by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil ('Les Miserables') has plenty of them.""', 'Joe Dziemianowicz for New York Daily News', '""Miss Saigon is ultimately stranded between extremes of cynicism and idealism: the Engineer's cartoonish hunger for American-style excess versus Kim's bland, maternal purity. What's lost in between is humanity or ambiguity, songs to tell us more about the characters' past, their quirks or inner nuances.

Review of Christmas Spectacular starring The Radio City Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall,"Yes, it's (already) that time of the year again, folks! We haven't even carved the Thanksgiving turkey yet, but that doesn't stop those fabulous Rockettes from donning a sparkling outfit or two and bringing us their annual Christmas Spectacular once again. No siree bub!"", ""Last night, I found myself in the vast Radio City Music Hall, sat across the aisle from an 8-year old boy and how I wished I could have been in his shoes for the night. Childhood should be brimming with awe, wonder and magic, and for this little theatre-goer, last night's entertainment was delivering that by the glittering bucket-load. Seeing a child's face light up as Santa enters the room and seeing his eyes beam as three dozen Santas follow (a group of gender-bending, disguised Rockettes) and seeing those same eyes nearly pop out of his head in amazement as those present are joined by an army of tightly choreographed Santas (by way of the huge LED backdrop) is simply priceless. Oh to be young again."", ""Let's make no mistake about it, this is the obligatory festive treat for the children of New York and those visiting. It's not, on the other hand, a must for all of us hardened musical theatre fans. There isn't much of a narrative to follow, rather Santa acts as a sort of jolly compère to shoe in those iconic dance numbers, some of which have probably been seen every year since 1933. The Sugarplum Fairy (now a giant teddy bear with diva aspirations) and The Nutcracker are still traditional favourites, whilst the modern child demands a theme-park style 3D projected movie (glasses provided) of Santa's sleigh and reindeer hurtling around the famous sights of Manhattan or remote-controlled floating snowflake beach-balls. Admittedly, there was also one or two moments when my own jaw dropped in disbelief - mainly with the inclusion of real sheep, camels and a donkey on the stage. They were, of course, main attractions in the Nativity scene, which sadly seemed a little out of place amongst the bombarding commercial aspects of Christmas. Where do those animals go between shows, I wonder? Do they take a gentle stroll down 5th Avenue?"", ""The Rockettes, as ever, remain the epitome of dance troupe perfection and dazzle in their elaborate costumes, beautifully designed by Gregg Barnes, Frank Krenz and Martin Pakledinaz. My date for the evening couldn't help but notice though how little they reflect the multi-racial city they call home with just two or three girls of colour. Yes, this really is a White Christmas, folks. But racial politics aside - and goodness knows, we have had more than our fair share of that recently - if you can embrace the child within, you can embrace the Christmas Spectacular."", 'Grab your kids or your young relatives and treat them to this all-singing, all-dancing, multi-media-spewing Winter Wonderland, which will no doubt remain with them for years and years to come.', '(Photo by Dan Niver)'",3,Good,Christmas Spectacular,other,other_genre,Negative,0.19,Positive,0.54
Bandstand,"Bandstand is a musical that treads the razor's edge - is it a romance or is it a veterans' salute? It is both, and makes no apologies. At times it also makes no sense, but the underpinning, which is the cost of war, carries the day. The opening number ""Just Like It Was Before"" puts us on notice that the world is filled with double meanings. Set in Cleveland in the latter half of 1945, this is the story of one G.I., Pfc. Donny Novitski (Corey Cott) who makes it home with all his ghosts in tact. One of them was his best pal, Michael. Donny was there when Michael died - they were stationed in the Pacific - and now that he is home he does what he promised he would do and visits Michael's widow Julia Trojan (Laura Osnes). And before you go any further, yes, I too wondered at this last name. No explanation is ever given, and this unfortunate choice stands out like, well, you know.', 'Donny is a piano man (as is Cott, and how refreshing it is to see these actors playing their own instruments). Aside from being instantly smitten by Julia (of course) he is also looking for work. He hits upon an idea to enter a contest with a band that not only will play FOR the vets but be made up entirely of vets. One by one he pulls these men in, Nick (Alex Bender), Johnny (Joe Carroll), Davy (Brandon James Ellis), Jimmy (James Nathan Hopkins), and Wayne (Geoff Packard). They, too, have their ghosts. One drinks too much. One is suicidal. One has memory lapses. All varying forms of what we would today call PTSD, but what was, back in the day, swept under the rug. The soldiers coming home form WWII had no listeners for their trauma. They were expected to come home, celebrate, breed and buy everything they could afford. The Greatest Generation was put on notice to become the first Consumer Generation.', 'This story is what happened to them in between the battle field and building suburbia. Once Donny and Julia meet, it is only a matter of time before she joins the band and brings a set of pipes that is just what the doctor ordered. As a widow, she brings that other side of war. Men prepare for the order of war; women prepare for the disorder. She also brings her own poetry that soon becomes music. The journey to the battle of the bands is on track.', 'Plotwise, this becomes a little too sweet as nothing much de-rails this train. Oh, there is the money that has to be raised. And there is the truth about how Michael died. But through it all there is never a question that this band will succeed and that Donny and Julia are destined to be together.', ""What saves this from death by saccharine is the raw nerves of these veterans. They seem too young to be that wounded, and there are those of us in the audience - we of a certain age - who remember our parents and the Memorial Day parades with the marching veterans. We remember the band music that played in our homes before the invasion of rock and roll. We remember the pictures. The uniforms. The pinned up hair. We remember that we baby boomers were born to a wounded generation who, for the most part, never discussed their war experience. They never had a chance to. They grew up rebounding from WWI, got catapulted into WWII and leapt into the 1950's with no maps to guide them."", 'It is their story that trails after you when you leave the theatre, much like the ghosts belonging to these characters.', 'It is too bad that the authors were not able to take a pair of clippers to the book, and the stunning lack of a resolution doesn't help. When the curtain call arrives it catches us off guard, and all we can do is cheer the performers and leave bewildered, wondering what we missed. Not the performances, nor the choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler - which are superb in the extreme. Cott and Osnes positively crackle and the ensemble work is spectacular in every way. But the basics of ""beginning, middle and end"" got left behind at the train depot. And all the big band music in the world doesn't quite make up for that.', '(Photo by Jermey Daniel)', '""""Bandstand,"" an openhearted, indecisive new musical, wants you clapping your hands and clenching your fists, tapping your toes and blinking back tears.

A Bronx Tale - The Musical,"It is the rare Broadway show that leaves its audience disturbed by gun violence and racial slurs even as they go happily humming doo-wop on their way out of the theater. And indeed it is the rare Broadway show that attempts to portray gangsters as something other than secretly good-hearted slobs. But such is the case with A Bronx Tale, a winningly performed but losing-ly scripted musical based on a movie based on a one-man show based partially on actual events.', ""Playwright and actor Chazz Palminteri gives us the coming of age tale of an Italian-American boy named Calogero (Hudson Loverro when a child, Bobby Conte Thornton when on the cusp of manhood). Young C, as he is called, faces the basic Shakespearean father figure dilemma. His biological dad, Lorenzo (Richard H. Blake) is a good-hearted, bus driving, family man, but the adult he truly admires is Sonny (Nick Cordero), an all-powerful mob kingpin. As he is busy being pulled in both directions, he falls for Jane (Ariana Debose), the right girl with the wrong skin color. Luckily for C, he lives in a musical theater world where no crisis lasts more than a couple minutes. Murders are forgotten about and accusations pivot for no apparent reason. In a less than satisfying conclusion, C's choice of male role model is made for him and he gets the girl, but then ultimately forgets her. And wait, was that a hint that maybe Lorenzo isn't his real father that went flying by? There's also a very confusing moment involving a guy running with a Molotov cocktail, but never mind."", 'This is a production that attempts to serve many masters, and the outcome is more jarring than it is synchronistic. Deadly beatings compete with Sergio Trujillo's lively dance numbers. A happy ensemble piece is immediately followed by a guy being shot in the head. Real life outcomes temper Palminteri's dramatic urges. Then sometimes, it becomes a classic Alan Menken musical. Set in the same era as Little Shop of Horrors, and about 180 blocks to the north of Mushnik's Flower Shop, the melodic parallels run deep. The opening number, ""Belmont Avenue,"" is a close cousin to Little Shop's opener, ""Skid Row,"" here with four doo-wop singers instead of three street urchins providing the harmonies. And later, when the towering Sonny sings to the naive Calogero over a raucous game of craps in ""Roll 'Em,"" it might as well be Little Shop's monster plant demanding blood from Seymour in ""Feed Me."" Glenn Slater's lyrics, though, are often too on the nose. Not only is there the nearly satirical, ""This is a Bronx tale,"" repeatedly intoned throughout, Calogero's ruminative song about interracial romance begins flatly, ""In a world like this, where everything seems black and white, in a world like this, they're so quick to tell you what's wrong and what's right.""', ""Fortunately, the cast shines, with Mr. Cordero being the brightest of the stars. Whether crooning, Sinatra-like, in a beautiful baritone, or endowing Sonny with just the right amount of pathos, he effectively steals the show from Mr. Thornton, who sings well but lacks Cordero's stage presence, or Palminteri's stage presence for that matter. The odd couple directing duo of Jerry Zaks and Robert De Niro find many a mobsterly detail to keep the huge ensemble busy. In a cinematic piece of staging that will undoubtedly be stolen when someone decides to write Goodfellas, the Musical, we meet Sonny's crew in a bar with the action pausing as each character poses for a mug shot while Sonny reels off his gangster nickname. It's highly reminiscent of the De Niro film. Meanwhile, Beowulf Boritt's smart scene design is full of towering fire escapes where various characters magically appear and then vanish. It's a fitting visual metaphor for a story about a boy who feels the heat as he tries to find the best way out of his childhood."", '(Photo by Joan Marcus)', '', '""Sometimes plain old pasta with red sauce is just what the doctor ordered.

Anastasia,"Anastasia is a perfectly crafted Broadway musical fairy-tale that is going to run forever.

It's billed as an original musical with book by noted playwright Terrence McNally, and music by Stephen Flaherty and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, the duo who brought us ""Ragtime"", and oh yes, the animated movie musical ""Anastasia.""', 'If you read the fine print in the Playbill under the writing credits in small print it says ""Inspired by the Twentieth Century Fox Motion Pictures."" There were two of them, a live-action film starring Ingrid Bergman and Yul Brenner in 1956, and the animated musical in 1997, which was the Fox Animation Studios most profitable film ever. Ah. Ding, ding, ding. Move over Disney, if you can do it, why can't Fox?', 'How about the fact that they're billing it as an ""original"" musical with a ""new score"" that's ""inspired"" by the movies? Most of the songs are the same, and the plot is largely the same with a few different characters. But, there is a new score. Which is the background music that plays under, around and between the scenes. Like in a movie. And, the character of Rasputin has been done away with from the animated film, and a new, softer villain introduced. A Soviet soldier, Deputy Commissioner Gleb Vaganov (Ramin Karimloo), who chases Anya/Anastasia (Christy Altomare) to Paris with orders to kill or capture her, but cannot find it in his heart to do so. As if.', 'Which brings us to the meat of the matter. The subject matter, that is. The big difference between the movies and the stage musical is time and science. When the movies were made, the true story of Anastasia was still a mystery and fair game for whatever invention or interpretation could be put on it. But in 2007, it was proved conclusively through DNA testing of remains found, that Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna was murdered along with the rest of her imperial family in Yekaterinburg, Russia by Bolshevik secret police.', 'But the Broadway Anastasia, is a fairy tale, where the beautiful young princess (alright, Grand Duchess but you know all the little girls are going to want to be ""Princess Anastasia""), manages to escape a dreadful fate, but winds up with amnesia.

The Empress announces that there is no Anastasia, wink, wink, so they can live in peace.', 'Anastasia, and it's movie predecessors, are fictional versions of the life of one of the many women who claimed to be the surviving Grand Duchess Anastasia, Anna Anderson. There was a £10,000,000 account of Tsar Nicholas II at stake in Britain so many were tempted to make the attempt. The most widely known claimant, Anna Anderson, first came to light in Berlin in 1922.

Aladdin,"In the UK, there is a Christmas tradition in British theatre called Pantomime. This phenomenon is foreign to American audiences, and is perhaps difficult to sell convincingly, but here goes: A pantomime takes the form of a tongue-in-cheek staging of a popular fairy tale, which encourages as much audience participation as possible. There is always a man dressed up as a ludicrous-looking woman known as the Dame (in the case of 'Aladdin' it's Widow Twanky), often a girl will play the lead male role (such as Peter Pan... Yes, it's all very gender-confusing) and a 'Dr. Evil-style' villain (who is constantly booed out of the building by the children in the audience, whenever he creeps onto the stage). There are also a few filthy jokes thrown into the mix, which fly straight over the childrens' heads and cheekily reward their accompanying parents. In short, the pantomime is a theatrical tradition that is belittled by theatre snobs, but wholeheartedly loved by families and secret 'guilty pleasure-seeking' theatregoers."", ""Although pantomime is relatively unknown in the States, having recently attended a performance of Disney's latest mega-hit 'Aladdin,' I feel it is the closest thing to it in the good ole U S of A. Particularly the performance of Jonathan Freeman as treacherous Jafar (a role he reprises from voicing the character in the original 1992 animated film) reminded me of the old-school pantomime villain. Alas, there was no sign of boisterous booing from the audience..."", ""The musical, whilst perhaps not as creatively imaginative as Disney's standard barer 'The Lion King,' it certainly gets more laughs and the book's wise-cracking one-liners, often Arabian-themed, lend some refreshing, adult satisfaction. Most of these come from the show-stealing performance of James Monroe Iglehart as Genie, whose Tony Award-winning turn is truly a delight to behold. Stepping into the shoes of the late great Robin Williams (surely one of the main reasons, the animated classic was so popular) must be daunting at the least, but Iglehart gives a new and unique life to the character, whilst maintaining Mr Williams' high levels of energy and pace. His tour-de-force number 'Friend Like Me,' simply put, is musical theatre heaven! He is also quite the accomplished dancer and as light on his feet as the rest of the ensemble."", ""Other comic relief comes in the form of Iago (a conniving parrot sidekick in the movie, now embodied as a short and stout human by Don Darryl Rivera), whose hilarious portrayal is a masterclass of comic timing. Three new additions to the cast are Aladdin's three, loyal buddies - Babkak, Omar and Kassim (Brian Gonzales, Jonathan Schwartz and Steel Burkhardt respectively) - who replace cheeky and loveable animated monkey Abu (although he does makes a cameo appearance on a poster in Act II!). These three amigos each have rounded characters and perform their comic sequences with vigour."", ""The costumes and sets are wonderfully bright and make the production the most vibrantly colourful of all Disney Theatrical's offerings to date. Hats off to the ensemble members who undergo several quick (and magnificent) costume changes during the procession within the single musical number of 'Prince Ali'!"", ""Finally, the performances of Adam Jacobs as Aladdin and Courtney Reed as Princess Jasmine, although overshadowed by Iglehart, shine especially during their musical numbers. Particular favourites are the duet 'A Million Miles Away' and Aladdin's recurring solo 'Proud of Your Boy,' which both add some much needed character depth and showcase each actors' beautiful vocals. And of course, who can resist being swept along by the extremely impressive magic carpet scene during 'A Whole New World'?"", 'As I left the stunning New Amsterdam Theatre, I heard a child asking her mother: ""How do they make that carpet fly, Mummy?""

So it was with some trepidation that I saw this show. Even though everyone has been raving about it, I was still cautious.', 'The good news is that this production bowls you over. You don't have a chance to not like it because it, like the Mormons it depicts, is positive that something good will happen if you just hang around for awhile.

Disappointment and enthusiasm are thus bound together and shipped east, way east."", 'Upon their arrival they meet villagers who are suffering from AIDS, drought, disease, and dictators. The villagers teach the two missionaries their favorite uplifting song, ""Hasa Diga Eebowai."" As life batters them in the head over and over again, it is this song that keeps them going.

Welcome to the world, boys.', 'At missionary HQ they meet a randy bunch of also white boys led by Elder McKinley (Rory O'Malley) who have nothing to show for their time in Uganda - no Baptisms, no nothin'. But they do have one thing: their own musical theme song to aid them in times of question and doubt. ""Turn It Off"" - as in, turn off anything that means questioning the Mormon path: thoughts of homosexuality, memories of abuse, guilt of any kind. Welcome to another world, boys.', ""What follows is a love story where Price and Cunningham have to find their own paths without the other's help. Price tries to flee his fate while Cunningham deals fast and loose with his proselytizing.

This subject is bandied about like a beach ball throughout the show along with child rape, frog rape, AIDS, maggot infestation, Spooky Mormon Hell, and Jesus.

So how has this iconic musical managed to outlast its competitors in the increasingly crowded and competitive market place that is Broadway?', 'One word can sum it all up, really… “Class”… which just so happens to be the title of one of the more reflective numbers in the show. As Velma and Mama Morton were serenading us, asking whatever happened to class, I couldn’t help but think that this production has it in abundance. Chicago proves that you don’t need to bombard your audience with a number of lavish sets or elaborate costume changes to put together a winning musical. All you need is a live band on stage, intoxicating the auditorium with that jazz-infused score from the genius that is John Kander and Fred Ebb and sprinkle it with that Bob Fosse-style choreography, and before you know it, you’ve razzle dazzled ‘em! Those tight-fitting, all-black (and often transparent) costumes by William Ivey Long enhance the show’s sensuality with equal measures of male and female exposure and have themselves become as recognisable as the show’s glittering red logo.', 'You forget how ground-breaking this revival must have been, when it officially opened on Broadway on 14th November 1996.

Some of the company’s principals have been with the show for quite some time and continue to delight with every performance. NaTasha Yvette Williams’ brassy and sultry Mama Morton, Raymond Bokhour’s ever-loveable Amos and R. Lowe’s skilled, gender-bending performance as Mary Sunshine are always crowd-pleasing and essential parts of the production, offering the degree of stability that takes it smoothly through its many cast changes.

It is rare that the trust and communication among an ensemble shines through in their work, but the cast of ', 'Half-God', ' seems to meld and move together, even when their characters are in conflict. Much of this charismatic connection comes from movement director Orlando Pabotoy’s choreography, which turns Ellams’s epic poem into dance theatre. Taibi Magar directs the thoughtful, meticulous ', 'New York Theatre Workshop', ' and American Repertory Theater co-production.', 'For those weary of Greek theatre, take heart in the fact that ', 'Half-God', ' grounds its story in basketball, using the sport as the backdrop for a war between men and mortals. Nigerian children, including Demi (Mister Fitzgerald), take the sport seriously and try to make their neighborhood games NBA-caliber; Demi is helped by his supernatural strength and precision, as he is the son of Zeus (Michael Laurence).', 'A journey to California and then the Olympics solidifies Demi’s place in basketball history, but other gods believe he is cheating. Nigerian American player Hakeem Olajuwon (Jason Bowen) appears to Demi and confesses that all great players are really half-gods, but that they’d signed a pact to stop competing with humans after Michael Jordan took flight on the court. “Grandfather had to wipe memories,” he says. The storyline mocks the grandeur of American sports culture, but never in a patronizing way, as if Ellams is in on the joke.', 'Audience members don’t have to be well-versed in basketball to appreciate the allegory of the game, which Sángó, a Nigerian thunder god, trains for by reading ', 'The Art of War', '. The actors narrate their characters’ actions and also speak their dialogue, which at times is superfluous and confusing. But Ellams’s language flows, for the most part, like Pabotoy’s choreography and the luscious fabric that symbolizes rivers stage. Like the ensemble, the show’s designers collaborate to create one cohesive being, with each discipline still allowed its moment in the spotlight, like scenic designer Riccardo Hernández’s rain or costume designer Linda Cho’s Statue of Liberty-inspired gown for the Yoruba river goddess Osún (Patrice Johnson Chevannes). Tal Yarden’s projection design is particularly adept, drawing in the audience with recurring motifs that keep us grounded in specific locations or times.', 'In the end, the story is led not by Demi, but by his mother Modúpé (Jennifer Mogbock, who also serves as dance captain), a priestess of Osún who captivates the power-hungry Zeus. Like other women before her, Modúpé becomes a victim of Zeus, bearing a half-god and wavering between grief and joy, content with her child but saddled with the weight of his violent conception. Pabotoy’s choreography for this violence is a reminder of the power of gesture, exchanging the literal for the subtler but piercing hearts all the same.', 'It is Modúpé’s pain and power that leads the story to a climax, though the phrasing of the concluding feminist faceoff is a bit awkward. The stilted dialogue threatens to undercut ', 'Half-God', '’s impact, but Magar’s production is too beautiful to be held down for long.

It is not Perlman's fault that the LCT3 play, now running at the "", 'Claire Tow Theater', ' and directed by Margot Bordelon, is lacking any substance to sustain the character’s witticisms.', 'Let’s Call Her Patty', ' is narrated by Sammy (Leslie Rodriguez Kritzer in classic form), Patty’s niece. Though Patty doesn’t agonize over Sammy’s every decision as she does with her biological daughter, she did raise Sammy after the death of her sister, Sammy’s mother. Sammy tells the audience repeatedly that a place makes a person — that is, that Patty is shaped by her Upper West Side environs, and that her personality would be different if she lived in, for example, Arizona with retirees and Sammy’s wife’s dying mother.', 'Patty is a walking Upper West Side stereotype: a Jewish woman of a certain age who doesn’t work, who has a car but doesn’t like to drive it, who takes a plethora of exercise classes and frets over her appearance. She’s a Democrat, but not too left-leaning. She’s Jewish, but not in a way that seems to matter to the plot; she just likes to kvetch at her unseen husband and eat Chinese takeout and complain about the JCC. Her relationship to New York is similarly superficial, defined only by its punchlines.', 'Despite its shortcomings of both delivery and development, ', 'Let’s Call Her Patty', ' is rife with plot: Patty learns her daughter Cecile (Arielle Goldman), a wayward artist who has perhaps inherited her mother’s disordered eating patterns, has a drug problem. We don’t know how or when it started, only that it’s escalated and that rehab is expensive and ineffective. (This is a notable problem in a country where the for-profit drug treatment model dominates, though this is not the focus of the play.)', 'Goldman is given almost no time to convey her struggles or indeed anything meaningful about her character. She communicates her anxiety most often through physical tics rather than dialogue, an interesting premise that suffers simply because Cecile is not onstage enough. The play isn’t about her, but Patty; but really, it’s about Sammy, or the tenuous ties among the women. ', 'Let’s Call Her Patty', ' isn’t grounded enough to feel like it’s about anything.', ""Its monologues feel like they were written just to be monologues (every audience member at Lincoln Center knows about climate change; paragraphs reminding us of its existence aren't revolutionary or even interesting). Shea seems to have written Patty so that an actor like Perlman could sell tickets to other Upper West Siders. A place makes a person insofar as the Upper West Side makes theatregoers with disposable incomes."", 'Kritzer is the production’s saving grace, a study in both perfectly timed delivery and physical comedy. She drops to the floor and rolls under set pieces like a school child in a fire drill, winks at the howling audience as she wisecracks about Patty, and convinces us that an unseen dog is truly onstage. Already a veteran character actor sculpted in the likeness of Perlman, Kritzer carries the play as it meanders and then abruptly concludes. Though Perlman’s comedic chops still shine in some moments, Kritzer’s Sammy is both the heart and humor of the piece.

Forty blocks uptown, the Public now mounts the original play — with a few cuts and updates — as this year's Free Shakespeare in the Park offering."", ""Beowulf Boritt's set depicts a finely furnished present-day house with a Stacey Abrams poster out front and a car with the license plate ELS NOR (a clever nod to Elsinore, the name of the Danish palace in Shakespeare's text) off to the side. The whole scene is half-buried and askew, suggesting a world turned upside down even before the events of the play begin."", ""Quick recap of said events: King Hamlet gets murdered by his brother Claudius before the play starts. Prince Hamlet (the title character, played here by Tony nominee Ato Blankson-Wood) gets a visit from his dad's ghost, who urges revenge. The young prince pretends to go mad while secretly plotting to kill his uncle.

Solea Pfeiffer, even in her comparatively little stage time, matches his skill as an Ophelia who demands to be heard. Daniel Pearce provides delightful comic relief as Polonius, and the masterful John Douglas Thompson almost makes the audience sympathize with Claudius before turning on a dime, ending Act 1 with a perfect line delivery and commanding exit.', 'Even with multiple smart scene cuts, ', 'Hamlet', "" still runs close to 3 hours, and you'll feel it in the second act — it's slower compared to the first. Greg Hildreth runs away with the act in his single scene as the wisecracking gravedigger, and just beforehand, Pfeiffer especially stands out in Ophelia's tour-de-force fit of madness. She not only gets to show off her gorgeous singing voice, but a blazing torrent of deep, enraged sorrow."", ""She's not overbearing with it, though — one of the strongest moments sees her laying flowers upon the other characters like graves as she speaks in controlled, bitter tones.

And now New York gets to bathe in the bombastic bloodshed of ', 'Dracula: A Comedy of Terrors', ', a goofy romp from Steve Rosen and Gorden Greenberg, at ', 'New World Stages', '.', 'On the one hand, it’s nice to see that there’s still fresh blood in this vampire — as Rosen and Greenberg have him, played dynamically by James Daly (Canada’s ', 'Letterkenny', ""), he's reinvented as an egotistical, selfish, emotionally unintelligent Adonis. On the other, the re-emergence of fanged fiction means that we as a society really are drowning in a wave of conservative politics."", 'Rosen and Greenberg, who co-authored the script while the latter also directs, seem to be aware of ditching the narrative fidelity to the novel in favor of remixing the source material’s target of social critique. If the Victorians were a repressed, sexist, and Machiavellian social order, ', 'Dracula: A Comedy of Terrors', ' makes a burlesque of their anxieties and fears. Jonathan Harker (Andrew Keenan-Bolger) is a coward, prissy real estate agent, most fearful of himself; Lucy Westfeldt (Kaitlyn Boyer) is an ambitious botanist relegated to marrying Harker; her father Dr. Westfeldt (Ellen Harvey, maybe miscast) is exploiting the mentally ill in his sanatorium; her sister Mina (Arnie Burton) is horny and desperately unmarried; and even Van Helsing (Burton again) is a woman doctor.', 'Dracula', '’s humor exaggerates the tautness between the strictures of social rules and rituals, the archetypes they create, and what happens when they’re transgressed. That kind of observation turned into absurdity feels best embodied by Daly’s Dracula. Daly is unafraid to make his ivory features a liability: he pouts his lips or falls to the ground gracelessly, which makes his performance all the more impressive.', 'His emotionally adolescent Dracula converges with the play’s attempt at engaging in the more serious business of wanting to liberate oneself from the very societal constraints the characters inhabit. While he’s experiencing an existential crisis in his desire for everything (and thus commitment to nothing), the rest of the ensemble’s desires occasionally come into focus. It’s Boatman who most effortlessly conveys this tonal transition of a woman who is torn between love and a bit of self-reliance and curiosity, but also between the genres Dracula situates itself within, like firecracker comedy and wailing melodrama.', 'The show makes it difficult to begrudge pointing out the occasional imprecise, maybe, I’ll say it, potentially transphobic “man in a dress” nature to some of the jokes because, after all, it advertises itself as a gender-bending reenvisioning of the text. But the jokes Harvey, who plays Renfield and Dr. Westfeldt, tells have more to do either with insanity or the doctor’s misogyny. Irony, certainly, but not necessarily the same as the joke being about Harvey crossing gender in her performance.', 'It’s a shame to have to mildly take the show to task because, next to Daly, Burton has the most fun on stage, truly going buck wild with his expressions and gestures, pushing ', 'Dracula', '’s tone to its very limits.

'Mary Gets Hers' review — ensemble play entertains and frustrates,"Read our review of Emma Horwitz's "", 'Mary Gets Hers', ', presented off Broadway by The Playwrights Realm at the Robert W. Wilson MCC Theater Space through October 7.', 'There is a lot of irony in ', 'Mary Gets Hers', ', a new play by Emma Horwitz running at ', 'MCC Theater', ' in a Playwrights Realm production. It is ironic to stage a play about a raging plague that “turned people into foam” a few years after the theatre industry shut down because of Covid-19. Horwitz seems to revel in this irony, showing off the tongue-in-cheek sadness of the child Mary (Haley Wong) and, later, her more frank devastation. It is also ironic, however, that ', 'Mary Gets Hers', ' gives us no reason to root for the title character beyond pitying her childhood circumstances.', 'Years after the death of her parents, Mary does not appear to have any desires beyond wanting them back – a reasonable wish for a real child, but not a compelling one for a protagonist. Most of the other characters are fleshed out with hopes, fears, insecurities, and ambitions, like the religious hermit Abraham (Susannah Perkins), who wants to prove himself to God and his mentor by procuring a pure virgin child for the abbey. Ephraim (Octavia Chavez-Richmond), his mentor, has arguments with God that form the core of the show’s heart. Chavez-Richmond’s balance of adroit humor and desperate supplication is a highlight that endears Ephraim to the audience.', 'Mary bemoans later that men who come from far and wide to, ahem, admire her beauty only love the image of her, like a hermit worships an icon. But Mary is just an idea in this loose adaptation of Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim’s ', 'Abraham, or the Fall and Repentance of Mary', ', running around in search of meaning.', 'Despite these character conundrums, ', 'Mary', ' is still an enjoyable show imbued with theatricality (tedious as it may get when, like Mary, you just want the hermits to stop singing). Spooky choreography lends the production a heightened air of near-Expressionism as the ensemble acts out Abraham’s nightmare of Mary’s worldly defilement. Lighting cues from Cha See further up the tension in Josiah Davis’s adept and entertaining production. But pantomime of invisible horses and hymns with all the lyrics replaced with “God” can only hold so much weight, and a repetition of lines that at first feels clever soon overstays its welcome.', 'You have to learn to love yourself “when everyone you love dies in a plague, there is no one to love you,” Mary croons like a disco diva at the end of the show, though we have no indication that she learned this lesson – certainly not through her near-instant forgiveness of Abraham, whom she had detested moments before for his meddling. ', 'Mary Gets Hers', ' tells us of such developments much more than showing them, although the showing, such as through dance, is much more interesting.', 'The ensemble’s worship of Mary might land if the character had more life or if Wong played her with more than one petulant note.

At least for the next 90 minutes, albeit hit-and-miss ones, I was in Madrid."", 'That may seem glamorous to us Americans, but as rendered by set designer Arnulfo Maldonado in Danny Tejera's play, the Spanish capital is no different than a suburban hometown, perhaps the kind your high school self longed to escape. All we see of it is an unfinished garage-turned-living space: A desk and laptop serve as the ""office"" (read: amateur DJ booth) of 26-year-old Juan (Juan Castano), who also makeshifts a living room from a loveseat, coffee table, and plastic chair, sandwiched in the space between the ""office,"" his parents' Audi, and lots of garden-variety junk.', 'It’s stuffed bordering on stifling. ', 'Toros', ' takes place over the course of a few pregames Juan hosts for his friends Toro (Abubakr Ali) and Andrea (b), an appropriate setup, as we meet these characters at transitional phases before they move on to other things — or try to. Juan isn’t particularly happy about playing host — or living in the garage at all — preferring to devote his attention to practicing his (unimpressive) DJing so he can finally make it out. That’s about all he’ll do, though. Toro at least escaped to New York, but crippling disillusionment with life brought him back. And Andrea, a kindergarten teacher with roots in multiple countries, now searches for stability, looking for it in the wrong people: these high school friends who should have all long outgrown each other.', ""We immediately get that sense upon Andrea’s arrival, when Juan starts relentlessly mocking Toro for his crush on her in order to mask his own. Things escalate from there, as Juan's trying to mask a lot more than that: a self-destructive impulse to push everyone else away; a deep insecurity in himself; an unwillingness to take any responsibility for the harm he inflicts on others, physical and emotional. Problem is, we never quite learn why, though there’s clearly more going on than a half-requited crush. Following a climatic incident (after which the play goes on 15 minutes too long), he offers a stunned Andrea a vague spiel about going through mental and emotional trouble. It's not a specific or deep enough reason to invest in him as a character."", 'All the characters, to a degree, feel underwritten. Toro and Andrea exist mostly as collateral damage in Juan’s self-destruction. They do get the play’s best scene: a vulnerable conversation in which they reveal their Tragic Backstories and probe meaty ideas about whether life is worth living — or ""real"" at all — if we're always doing what's expected of us. But one scene does not a full character — or thought-provoking play — make, especially as their last onstage conversation is mostly small talk. To Tejera's credit, neither their lofty debate nor their awkward patter feels like a playwright's hand at work; he has a knack for authentic dialogue.', ""Director Gaye Taylor Upchurch's production is nonetheless buoyed by its cast, particularly the effortlessly magnetic b. Alongside the trio is Frank Wood as Juan's aging dog, Tica. While Wood is commendably game, the presence of the dog is mostly distracting, her intended significance unclear until she, too, becomes a pivotal plot device in service of Juan’s arc."", 'The play ends on an abrupt and ambiguous note, Juan mysteriously far from the action even as his presence still looms large in the garage despite all the other characters actually being there. It’s the time we most want to see him, to finally understand the reason for his anger and its impact not just on the others, but on himself. We still never get it.

In her glittery silver pantsuit, Bloom dribbles a basketball, poses coyly under a parasol, and tries to rock a makeshift baby to sleep without killing it. She asserts her desire to perform a show written in 2019, one that relies on hacky jokes to establish a pre-pandemic world order, until an interloper forces her to confront reality.', '“The world is back to normal,” she proclaims near the top of the show, then admits later, when discussing the Covid surge affecting audience members right now, that the world is not normal. It never will be again.', 'Perhaps this lack of normalcy explains why Bloom can’t find her footing onstage, a place where she has historically been both comfortable and confident. ', 'Death, Let Me Do My Show', ' is part stand-up comedy, part musical theatre extravaganza, and part confessional, and its effect is as disjointed as these elements.', 'Fans of her television series ', 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend', ' may be surprised: The show that brought Bloom an Emmy Award and a cult following blended flashy music numbers about mental illness with irreverent humor that flew in the face of network sitcom rules. In ', 'Death', ', Bloom doesn’t achieve this same balance of tones, and is in fact accused by Death himself (embodied as a heckler in the form of her ', 'Crazy Ex', ' costar David Hull) of avoiding difficult conversations.', 'This most difficult conversation is known to any ', 'Crazy Ex', ' fan in the audience: the death of the songwriter Adam Schlesinger, Bloom’s writing partner. In March 2020, Bloom gave birth a daughter who was unable to breathe and was placed on a ventilator, while across the country, Schlesinger fell victim to the first wave of Covid and was also intubated. Soon after Bloom brought her daughter home from the NICU, Schlesinger died.', 'This one-two punch sprouted in Bloom a new fear of death. She feared her daughter would die in her sleep or that her dog would die before her child had memories of it — leading her to pepper a corner of the nursery with commissioned paintings of the pooch. She wasn’t afraid she’d be haunted by the ghosts of those she’d lost (including a colleague and her psychiatrist in quick succession after Schlesinger), but that she would never be.', '“Is a Civil War soldier whose face has been destroyed really as scary as an unfeeling void?” she asks of the afterlife in “The Spookiest Scariest Ghost,” a Halloween parody song and the only number that marries witty and macabre in her signature style.', 'The rest of the show feels incohesive, particularly the banter between Bloom and Hull, which comes across as unfinished in more of a missed deadline manner than an improv comedy one. Seth Barrish of the Barrow Group directs, but leaves no personal touch.', 'The show instead leaves the impression that Bloom is rushing to process grief, joy, and the last decade of her career before the pop culture moment moves on.

Thankfully, she goes back to baking.', 'Audible Theater’s production of ', 'Swing State', ', now off Broadway at the ', 'Minetta Lane Theatre', "", first bowed at Chicago’s Goodman Theatre last year. Under the deft direction of Robert Falls, the all-star cast mines the play's themes of loss, longing, and depression with a quiet edge and surprising humor."", 'Swing State', ', named in part for its divisive political setting in Wisconsin, also represents the liminal space between two opposing truths. Peg, a recent widow, swings from bouts of depression to sprinkles of hope. As the steward of a nearly 50-acre prairie, she delights in observing the cone flowers bloom and the sunrise over the bluff. She also feels despair that fewer nighthawks, monarch butterflies, and chorus frogs inhabit the endangered ecosystem.', 'Peg’s neighbor Ryan (Bubba Weiler) also swings between disparate states. The young man is protective of Peg, and he also seeks her support as he eases back into work and sobriety after serving time for a felony battery conviction. In one scene, when Ryan experiences a panic attack, Peg kneels beside him and leads him through a breathing exercise. She asks if she can help him find a counselor. “Why would I need a counselor when I got you?” he retorts.', 'Peg and her late husband, Jim, became surrogate parents to Ryan and visited him in prison. They even paid taxes on his house so that he’d have a home to return to. Peg, a former school guidance counselor, wants every species on the prairie to have a home to return to. She’s anxiously waiting for the Henslow’s Sparrow to migrate back to the land to nest. She tills the prairie, hoping wildflowers will sprout from season to season, finding a permanent home in the tall grass.', 'As part of her desire to preserve and promote life on the prairie, Peg asks Ryan to sign her will, which stipulates that he’ll receive her house and three acres, and a non-profit organization will take ownership of the remaining prairie land. “You’re being morbid as shit!” exclaims Ryan when she presents the paperwork.', 'Peg’s carefully laid out end-of-life plans falter when she discovers her late husband’s tools and prized Winchester rifle are missing from the barn.

Will the depressed artist die, or the diabetic whose symptoms are rapidly increasing? How about the unstable, PTSD-laden veteran, or the anesthesiologist with an alcohol problem? The show is a puzzle begging you to solve it and clocking your distraction as you try.', 'Death, who inhabits the characters at various points, becomes a reprieve from the awkward tension of missed connections and the escalation of conflict as Emilio (Caleb Eberhardt) tears everyone down, determined to destroy what remains of his relationships.', 'Emilio is smart and apparently a great artist, but he is also insufferable, spouting off societal observations like he’s the first to ever voice them. He is sometimes oblivious to his patronizing tone, though sometimes seems aware of how much he hurts his old friends, goading them until they snap. He directs much of his ire at Caitlin (Susannah Flood), his former best friend and confidante whom he now resents for marrying a “shithead” instead of him.', 'Though the friends gather together for their 20th high school reunion, they remain alone. Caitlin has lost her husband to online conspiracy theories, Emilio harbors a secret about his own relationship, Ursula’s (Brittany Bradford) social life shrank since she lost vision in one eye, and Kristina (Shannon Tyo) shunned her husband and turned to alcohol to cope with the trauma of intubating Covid patients.', 'The only one who insists he’s fine is Paco (Bobby Moreno), a veteran and Caitlin’s high school boyfriend who shows up at the pre-reunion gathering unannounced. (“But he wasn’t in our class,” Emilio protests when Kristina drags Paco, who is also her cousin, to the nostalgia-laden party on Ursula’s porch.) Though 20 years have gone by, Emilio remains obsessed with his friend group’s identity as MERGE, the Multi-Ethnic Reject Group Experience, a moniker he’s apparently clung to while his friends have grown up and moved on (though most have remained in their hometown).', 'Jacobs-Jenkins’s characters employ an ironic device when one believes another is “harshing the buzz” or “rambling”: They pretend to kill each other, snapping their necks and stabbing one another when someone’s joke gets old or they’re too stoned to know how long they’ve been talking. No one took this approach to Jacobs-Jenkins’s script, though director Eric Ting cut at least 10 minutes of runtime before press performances. Though its dialogue is sharp and its characters memorable, ', 'The Comeuppance', ' tries to hold down too many conversations at once, stretching an arm into every pot.', 'Not every thread ties up in the end; Emilio’s fixation on the Columbine shooting comes through in both his hatred of the military and his violent outbursts, but a tale of his desire to photograph reactions to the September 11 attacks falls flat. In the story, told via phone by Simon, a friend who couldn’t make the reunion, Emilio seizes on the news of 9/11 as an opportunity to document the reactions of his classmates, hoping he can win a Pulitzer Prize. He regrets the incident now.', 'So why include it? Emilio laments that he abandoned photography because he “got tired of realism,” but Jacobs-Jenkins has Simon list current events in a monologue: Trump, Covid, Roe v.

As it charts the rise and fall of Alan Freed, a legendary deejay who broke racial barriers in the 1950s and popularized rhythm and blues with mainstream audiences, it creaks as often as it rocks thanks to a predictable script and uneven mix of music.', 'Fortunately, the show has saving graces. One is the easy-to-like Constantine Maroulis leading the way as Freed. Known for playing an ’80s hair band member in the musical ', 'Rock of Ages', ', Maroulis is an able actor and singer (even in a wig that seems to have dropped from the sky). He hits the right notes as the show covers Freed’s eventful career.', 'The show’s other big asset is the ’50s music that Freed spun on air and aggressively promoted. Evergreen earworms like “Peggy Sue,” “Roll Over Beethoven,” and “Great Balls of Fire” come fast and furious in concert sequences when cast members stand in for the likes of early rock and roll icons Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, and Jerry Lee Lewis.', 'Other sonic highlights come from a group of singers who nail the rich and velvety harmonies on such familiar songs as “Sixty Minute Man” and “Smoke Gets In Your Eyes.” Valisia LeKae stands out as the fiery R&B singer LaVern Baker, who serves up her hits including “Tweedle Dee” and “Jim Dandy.” Expect head-bobbing from the audience.', 'On the other hand, ', 'Rock & Roll Man', ' gets rough around the edges when it comes to its original songs. Gary Kupper’s compositions turn up as garden-variety ballads and place-fillers instead of driving the story. They’re no match for the oldies but still goodies.', 'The story, by Kupper, Larry Marshak, and Rose Caiola, seizes upon the well-worn idea that life flashes before your eyes before you die. In Freed’s final vision, he imagines he and his legacy are on trial for crimes against the world. Yes, there was a time when rock music was considered a threat to society.', 'Freed’s defense lawyer is – good golly! – Little Richard (Rodrick Covington, a bit too cartoonish). The prosecutor is G-Man J. Edgar Hoover (a growly Bob Ari), who had Freed in his crosshairs.', 'The fever dream device is really just a way to flash back to watch Freed’s life unfold in predictable “and then this happened” fashion. We see Freed go from a Cleveland disc jockey playing mainstream tunes in the early 1950s to a radio sensation and concert producer in New York. He went on to coin the term “rock and roll” and was on top of the world.', 'Two characters played in broad strokes by Joe Pantoliano helped get Freed there. Leo Mintz owned a record shop where Black and white teenagers hung out together. Morris Levy, who ran a record company and owned Birdland Jazz Club, helped Freed break into producing concerts. Levy’s reputed mob ties meant his assistance came with strings.', 'Freed dodged various setbacks along the way but crashed following an investigation led by Hoover. He was accused of taking money to play records as well as claiming songwriting credits on tunes he didn’t author. Freed sank into obscurity and the bottle.', 'Over the show’s 2-plus hours, the design team’s work evokes a fitting period vibe. Director Randal Myler’s staging could never be accused of being subtle. When Hoover removes his shirt to reveal women’s lingerie underneath, it’s a little cheesy.', 'Following his death in 1965 at age 43, Freed was ultimately inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.

Six decades later, that outcome still stings.', 'But on stage, ', 'Days of Wine and Roses', "" ends up easier to respect for its ambition, and O’Hara and Brian d’Arcy James's stellar work, than to wholeheartedly recommend. The show fails to convince this is a story that sings."", 'In 1950 New York City, Korean War vet Joe Clay (James) works in public relations, and he’s good at his job — even the unsavory bits. That includes procuring women to entertain clients at business events. After a few drinks, he mistakes Kirsten Arnesen (O’Hara), his boss’s secretary, for one of these party girls. She sets him straight.', 'It’s a meet-awkward, not meet-cute. But it plants the seed for their relationship to bloom. From the jump, booze is front and center. Joe drinks and doesn’t like doing it alone. Kirsten is a teetotaler. “I never have,” she says. “I don’t like the taste.” He asks, “What do you like?” Her answer – chocolate – changes both their lives.', 'He serves her a Brandy Alexander, a dessert cocktail that goes down sweet and easy. She likes it. A lot. Soon she’s graduated — if that’s the right word  — to Johnny Walker, champagne, and margaritas. In a bouncy but unsettling number, they sing: “Two dolphins breakin’ a wave, two dolphins right to the grave are we.”', 'Joe and Kirsten’s romance is its own whirlwind. They date, get married, and have a baby, Lila (Ella Dane Morgan), who’s 7 years old before you know it in Lucas’s adaptation. Scenes shift seamlessly on a set of sliding and twirling glass doors and mobile set pieces in the staging by director Michael Greif (', 'Next to Normal', ').', 'The whole time, Joe and Kirsten drink like fishes, which may explain all of the water imagery. She can’t even vacuum their apartment without getting tipsy. Eventually, the descent into booze leads to career repercussions and, thanks to a lit cigarette, a catastrophe at home. Kirsten’s stern father (Byron Jennings) blames Joe for getting his daughter hooked.', 'The couple’s vows and efforts to stop drinking work – until they don’t. When one gets sober, the other pulls the other back to the bottle in a truly vicious cycle. Lila sees everything. Joe and Kirsten can’t be together unless they’re both not drinking — and that’s a long shot.', 'Guettel’s Tony-winning score for ', 'Piazza', ' was shot through with romance and memorable melodies.

Those are the closing lyrics of the bachata song ""Como abeja al panal"" — ""like a bee to the honeycomb"" — by Juan Luis Guerra, which inspired Guadalís Del Carmen's Off-Broadway debut play, ', 'Bees and Honey', ', at MCC Theater in collaboration with The Sol Project.', ""Guerra's song is about a forbidden passion, whereas Del Carmen's play is about a marriage. But both depict a deep, desperate love between two people that's either the best thing to ever happen to them or the thing that will destroy them."", 'In ', 'Bees and Honey', ', Manuel and Johaira, the only two characters on stage in the play's 2 hours, initially fall for each other while dancing bachata (a theme I wish was incorporated more throughout). Subtly and naturally, they gradually lose their inhibitions and melt into each other. It evokes the age-old cliche, ""the rest of the world faded away,"" a feeling that extends to the audience thanks to Reza Behjat's hypnotic lighting. Soon enough, they're married and living in a Washington Heights apartment, hoping to have a child, hoping to advance their careers, hoping, unspoken, to change each other.', ""Lots more familiar tropes pop up throughout Del Carmen's script: judgmental in-laws, the impending move-in of an ailing mother, the shadow of class differences (Johaira is a lawyer from a higher-class background; Manuel is a working-class owner of a mechanic shop) lurking beneath their arguments. They don't read so much as tropes, though, as much as painfully common obstacles of marriage. Whether Manuel and Johaira can surmount them, once the novelty of each other has worn off and they can't skate by on carefree romance, is the question."", ""Of course, that setup as a whole is familiar. What sets Del Carmen's script apart, even as its scenes are structurally repetitve at times, is that she shows a couple actively trying, or at least trying to try, to work on themselves. I one scene, for example, Manuel interrupts Johaira as she rehearses a court statement; in a later one, he watches her proudly from the doorframe, waiting until she's finished. Making bigger changes is a bit harder — Johaira doesn't like to compromise, Manuel resists therapy, and both throw themselves into their jobs at the expense of each other — but the small moments of triumph make you want to root for them."", ""That's also a testament to the actors, both perfectly cast as the opposites-attract (another classic trope) pair. Xavier Pacheco endears as the cheeky Manuel, whose lack of interest in academia belies a deep sensitivity and emotional intuition. He is fiercely loyal, especially to his family, and commits 100% to all he does, and Pacheco never holds back from playing him to the fullest degree of all his feelings."", 'Opposite him, Maribel Martinez is captivating as the savvy, booksmart Johaira, who undergoes a truly heartbreaking 180 when unforeseen tragedy strikes. Though one misfortune (yes, there are multiple) is predictable early on, it is no less devastating and shocking to watch Martinez crumple under its weight, showing how grief can change a person into someone entirely new.', 'Performed mostly in English with plenty of Dominican Spanish phrases peppered in, ', 'Bees and Honey', "" may be familiar in many places, but it depicts a distinctly Latino love story, and the deep love the playwright, actors, and excellent director Melissa Crespo have for these characters' community is evident.

When it comes to every decision, she is, to quote her pet phrase repeated 10 times over the course of the play, 100% “crystal clear.”', 'But is she really? Writer and director Robert Icke has painstakingly constructed the play to be murky. “It’s important that the audience are never told whether the character is male or female,” he notes about Ruth’s partner in the script.', 'As such, several characters are cast against gender and race to keep the audience off balance and to spark thought about identity and preconceived perceptions and prejudices. It’s potentially provocative, but it’s used so much here the impact is diluted. The device takes you out of the play and into a guessing game.', 'Similarly, Icke juggles so many hot-topic themes – abortion, Alzheimer’s, anti-Semitism, and that’s just the A’s –  the play gets diffuse. At its best, ', 'The Doctor', ', which is based on a 1912 play by Arthur Schnitzler, raises a straightforward, chilling point: One decision can alter the entire trajectory of a carefully constructed life.', 'That’s what happens to Wolff – “double-f,” she notes, to separate herself from the beast –  the celebrated founding director of the Elizabeth Institute, which is bent on beating Alzheimer’s. In glimpses of her home life, we see how Wolff relates to that on a personal level. Her colleagues refer to her as BB, as in Big Bad. That nickname actually fits. Wolff does a whole lot of huffing and puffing and hollering.', 'That escalates when Wolff’s patient, a 14-year-old girl who develops a fatal infection after taking abortion pills, dies under her care. Exactly what a teenager is doing at a dementia institute is a glaring question. Icke covers it curtly and conveniently. “I saw her come out of the ambulance,” says Wolff.', 'The case gets more complicated by the minute. The patient’s parents are Catholic, and before she dies a priest arrives to administer last rites. Wolff refuses to let him into the girl’s room. She claims that she doesn’t want the patient to be upset. Push comes to shove between the doctor and the priest – and Wolff is the one who gets physical. To stir the pot further, Wolff is Jewish. It later comes out that the priest, who’s played by an actor cast against type, is Black.', 'The incident becomes headline news as online naysayers denounce Wolff. It’s a public relations catastrophe for the institute, which is looking to expand. Wolff and her career come under intense fire. Some colleagues support her, while others can’t defend her actions because of their faith, ethics, or aspirations to take over the institute.', 'The play is like an inverted onion – layers pile on. The second half of the play reviews its hot topics when the embattled Wolff appears on a TV show called ', 'Take the Debate', '. Panelists take on Wolff about race, religion, faith versus medicine, abortion, the right to choose, and more. The move that feels a bit contrived since Wolff wouldn’t put herself in a vulnerable position.', 'Icke, who brought his stagings of ', 'Hamlet', ' and ', 'Oresteia', ' to the ', 'Park Avenue Armory', "" last year, underscores the story with a live drummer.

'Wet Brain' review – an otherworldly look at generational trauma,"Read our four-star review of John J. Caswell, Jr.'s "", 'Wet Brain', ', a genre-bending play co-produced by Playwrights Horizons and MCC Theater, on through June 25.', 'John J. Caswell, Jr.’s ', 'Wet Brain', ' is a kitchen sink drama with a running faucet. The play grapples with addiction and loss, and it builds and builds like water pressure. Set in Arizona, three wayward siblings converge in the family home to care for their ailing, alcoholic father. There is a steady stream of troubles for the family, all afflicted by addiction, and the leak cannot be fixed. Or, perhaps, no one is up for the challenge.', 'Wet Brain', ', co-produced by ', 'Playwrights Horizons', ' and MCC Theater, offers a gripping, grating look at alcoholism and its effects on loved ones. The family patriarch, Joe (played with precision by Julio Monge), suffers from “wet brain,” a cognitive impairment caused by alcohol abuse. Joe is non-verbal, staggers across the stage, and experiences a distorted reality — he is often in another world, one possibly inhabited with extraterrestrials.', 'His daughter Angelina (Ceci Fernández) takes up the mantle of caring for him, but as an overworked nursing student, she enlists her brothers to help monitor their father. Joe is so far gone that his adult kids keep water bottles filled with vodka around the unkempt house to keep him at status quo and take turns keeping watch so he does not inflict self-harm. This environment is triggering for Ricky (Arturo Luís Soria), the estranged brother who left home to earn an M.B.A. and returns after six years.', 'The eldest brother, Ron (Frankie J. Alvarez), is perhaps the most affected by his father’s looming loss. His attempt to comfort his dad is to come over every morning and help him get ready for the day, pretending the pair will head off to work at the family’s auto mechanic garage. Joe, of course, is unable to work and stays home, hobbling around the house and drinking.', 'The play is supremely depressing, but there are moments of lightness, humor, and wonder that surprise. The comedy comes from the trio of siblings who probe wounds, poke fun, and recall childhood memories, all with humor, in the way only close siblings can do.', 'The three characters also hold a mirror up to one another, reflecting their myriad issues of alcohol and drug abuse, disordered eating, and mental illness. Ron tries to hide his dependence on alcohol by storing six packs in the toilet tank — his siblings are not so easily duped. These are all blows of a traumatic childhood. Besides their father’s illness, their mother died of suicide on Christmas Eve when the kids were young. There’s an unshakable, painful bond between the siblings, and the actors excavate the love beneath the surface through their tender performances.', ""Director Dustin Wills deftly navigates the genre-bending play as it moves between comedy, tragedy, and horror. Yes, horror. Through its immersive design, audiences are stuck in the family's discomfort, watching on like looky-loos peeping at a highway crash."", 'The set (by scenic designer Kate Noll) features a disheveled house with a large tree emerging from behind the roof, a sign of life outside the walls. The house, with its rocky foundation, spins from side to side between scenic transitions as eerie music (by co-sound designers Tei Blow and John Gasper) and flashing lights (by Cha See) transport the audience somewhere else entirely, perhaps inside Joe’s hallucinatory brain.', 'In the play’s most inventive, moving scene, the family ventures to a liminal plane that might be outer space. Projections (by Nick Hussong) of stars and planets whiz by as the family hangs on to an upside-down family room. They engage in painful, emotional conversations about the family’s trauma, and in this arena, Joe speaks fluidly and confidently. The scene evokes childlike wonder.', 'The play lacks a clear takeaway; rather, it offers up an examination of love and loss. Audiences go on a wild, wandering journey that casts addiction in a raw light. In Caswell Jr.’s play, the characters do not project judgment or disdain on their father or one another for their issues. They probe the truth of how mental illness and addiction trickled into their generation, and, by the end, they look for a way to fix the leaky faucet.', 'Wet Brain is at Playwrights Horizons through June 25.

If Harper seems tired by the end, it’s because Kenneth is tired: tired of explaining himself to others, who he assumes can’t understand him; tired of chasing after his lost friend, Bert (Eric Berryman), the only person he knows will accept him; tired of feeling like an outsider in the majority-white place he's lived his whole life that doesn't know what to do with him, a seemingly neurodivergent man whose mother died when has a child. Though the play is a tight 95 minutes, it leaves the impression that we can only leave when Kenneth finds rest."", 'Buoyed by a broader discussion of who society leaves behind and at the margins, ', 'Primary Trust', ' is an intimate character piece handled with tenderness by director Knud Adams. Throughout, a musical accompanist (Luke Wygodny) slams a call bell to trigger jumps in time. Kenneth, anxious and eager to please, seizes these small do-overs, as if in a Suzuki acting exercise, then shrinks as he muddles his thoughts again and again. He can only say what he means when he’s talking to Bert or addressing the audience; the device only feels tired when Kenneth neatly explains the mystery of  Bert’s presence in his life.', 'Dressed a little like the ', 'Sesame Street', ' character (in costumes by Qween Jean), the imaginary Bert is one clue that something in this world is off. Kenneth fears others will see him talking to Bert in public, but Corrina (April Matthis), a waitress at Wally’s who befriends him, implies their conversations are not had aloud. “You never talk to anybody,” she says of Kenneth’s time at the restaurant. “I’m the first person you’ve had a full conversation with.” Something in Cranberry is not quite real, even as the performances and relationships among the characters feel grounded.', 'The most gratifying element of ', 'Primary Trust', ' is its ending, which at first hints at the tidy closure of stories, as if the characters are dolls about to be put back in their boxes. Kenneth earns a predictable achievement at work, says he might go finish his college degree, and begins to socialize with his colleagues instead of spending evenings alone.', 'But life is not picture-perfect like Ginsberg’s model town. “Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, screaming, scared that I’ve done something wrong,” Kenneth confesses.

Kingsman doesn't hold back in her critique of the genre: As Dana, the put-together boss within ', 'Wildfowl', ', Kingsman drops the particularly pointed line, ""You're not a mess, you just want to be seen as one.""', ""But Kingsman's show is first and foremost a comedy act itself, and it goes in its own zany, original direction. "", 'One Woman Show', ' features plenty of tongue-in-cheek jabs at tired tropes (""I'm having a remember,"" she says as Daniel Carter-Brennan's lighting signals the start of a flashback), but it also includes interpretive dancing and an unexpectedly hilarious subplot about tall drink of water (he's 8' 9"", Kingsman states) named Phil, who she first sees on the subway. Phil's subsequent arrival in her office plants the seeds for a whirlwind fling to bloom in the absence of her aloof boyfriend, Jared.', 'If ', 'One Woman Show', ' simply skewered the ', 'Fleabag', ' genre for trying too hard to be ""edgy,"" ""vulnerable,"" and ""different,"" it would run the risk of falling into that exact same trap.

"'The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart' review — an enchanting, immersive experience","Read our four-star review of ', 'The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart', ', a drama currently playing off Broadway at The McKittrick Hotel through April 30 only.', 'Upon arrival at the ', 'McKittrick Hotel', '’s Club Car space, audience members receive shots of whiskey and are instructed to tear napkins at their cocktail tables. The National Theatre of Scotland’s rollicking, immersive tale of ', 'The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart', ', which first bowed at the McKittrick in 2017, begins with a snowstorm of paper napkins.', 'It’s the morning of the winter solstice, and buttoned-up academic Prudencia Hart (Charlene Boyd) is preparing to attend a conference on Scottish folk studies. Prudencia is an expert on the oral transmission of Scottish ballads and studies the topic of hell in traditional folk music. Even the lofty linguistic experts attending the conference find that strange, particularly her archenemy, Dr. Colin Smye (Ewan Black). He’s an expert on football chants.', 'The snowbound attendees retreat to a pub for a raucous evening of karaoke and debauchery — Prudencia’s personal hell. She’d rather hide out at a nearby bed and breakfast. The rowdy karaoke singers warn Prudencia not to wander outside alone, because on the evening of a solstitial full moon, the devil lurks in the dark to collect souls. What happens next might be a hypothermic or liquor-induced nightmare.', 'Director Wils Wilson, who co-created the show with David Greig, leads with imagination. The cast employs physical theatre tricks. In one scene, Prudencia sits on the bar, and castmates form a makeshift car around her, a violin bow serving as a windshield wiper as she drives. In another, an audience member’s arms become the handles of Colin’s motorcycle, while a cast member ruffles his scarf behind him in the wind. Janice Parker’s movement direction is all-encompassing, and the troupe dances on tabletops and snakes between the crowd throughout the show, sometimes pulling the audience into the action.', 'This inventiveness extends to the music. The cast of five play Scottish folk music and produce various sound effects with spoons, kazoos, glass bottles, and even a crinkly bag of potato chips held in front of a microphone to imitate the sound of a 1700s phonograph. The show’s musical playfulness (led by music director Alasdair Macrae) balances its spooky, supernatural themes.', 'The Club Car, transformed into a lively Scottish pub, is a character in and of itself. The most impressive element of the immersive design, by Georgia McGuinness, is the lighting. Rows of orb lights glow like full moons. The pendant lights change color; pink when Prudencia is seemingly in control, red when the devil is, and multicolor when no one is. (The lights flash rainbow colors during the karaoke bit.) In one scene, the space goes pitch black, and cast members spotlight each other with torch lights to eerie effect. In another, candles on the cocktail tables are the sole source of light.', 'Prudencia’s undoing is both literal and figurative. Throughout the show, her crown braids unfurl, her pussy-bow blouse unravels, and her prudent disposition unknots. Boyd graciously leads the character through this transition with a robust voice and steadfastness.', 'The multi-talented ensemble takes on roles of academics, revelers, and hellish tempters. All are superb. Gavin Jon Wright makes for a steely devil, Ewan Black brings the laughs, and Natali McCleary steals the spotlight as a ghostly figure singing the folk tune “Blackwaterside.” Throughout the show, musician Charlie West impressively plays a host of instruments, including the fiddle.', 'Like good bartenders, or gracious bed and breakfast hosts, the cast and crew of ', 'The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart', ' offer the audience ham and gruyère sandwiches at intermission. The sandwiches, plus the whiskey and specialty cocktails for sale, help settle the crowd into the storytelling.

The world premiere tuner at ', 'The Public Theater', ' features a book by Suzan-Lori Parks and songs by Jimmy Cliff, including reggae hits such as “You Can Get It If You Really Want” and “Many Rivers to Cross,” plus new songs by Parks.', 'Scenic designers Clint Ramos and Diggle transform the Public’s Newman Theater space into a Jamaican shanty town with colorful tin structures covered in palm fronds, globe lights, and music speakers. The stage creatively features two spinning turntables, resembling a disc jockey’s one and twos.', 'The musical follows Ivan (an impressive Natey Jones in his U.S. debut), a country boy with city dreams. His determination is unflappable, and he arrives in the capital of Jamaica swinging. “Hello, Kingston! Me name Ivan! I’m going to make a record, you know. I’m going to be a star!” The busy throng of shopkeepers, residents, and trade workers bristle at his unbridled enthusiasm.', 'Ivan finds work at a congregation, where he falls for Elsa (Meecah), the ward and love interest of the preacher (J. Bernard Calloway). With Elsa in tow, Ivan leaves the church and finds a job at a dance club. He records a song with the powerful music producer Mr. Hilton but refuses to sign the low contract he offers. Ivan wants to do things his way. Unbeknownst to Elsa, Ivan begins working in the “fishing business” — the ganja trade — to earn a living and support his musical career.', 'The music industry and the ganja industry, it turns out, are inextricably linked. Ivan rocks the boat wherever he goes, and instead of making a music record, he winds up mounting a criminal record. ""Around here, it takes more than talent to get a fair shake,"" he laments. ""People trying to keep me down everywhere I turn!""', 'Directors Tony Taccone and Sergio Trujillo lead with airtight precision. The musical moves quickly, and the propulsive energy is in constant motion. One of the most inventive scenes is set at The Rialto, a cinema where Ivan and some acquaintances watch a Western film. A white sheet becomes the film screen, and spinning velvet sets become a barrier as the moviegoers engage in a rousing game of cowboys and Native Americans while singing “Hero Don’t Never Die.” (It’s a bit of foreshadowing for Ivan’s hero journey.)', 'Another strong (and quick) scene begins with the congregation singing the hymnal “Closer Walk With Thee.” The prayer swiftly turns into a dance-hall fantasy, and as Elsa averts her attention from Jesus to Ivan, she strips off her choir robe to reveal a tight-fitting dress. Ivan and Elsa dance and gyrate on a club platform (choreography is by Edgar Godineaux), and the surrounding choir members disrobe and rapidly dress again to finish the hymn. The preacher remains in place, unmoored.', 'Jones is one of many strong performers. Upon meeting Elsa, Ivan declares, “You sing like a bird, you know.” Indeed, Meecah and her beautiful voice shine in this role. Like Ivan, Elsa is a big dreamer, and she charms and inspires. Another standout performance is Jacob Ming-Trent as Pedro, Ivan’s loyal best friend who helps him settle in Kingston. Pedro takes center stage for his big number, “The Ballad of Ivan,” driving support for Ivan as his friend runs from the police.', 'The cost of fame is very high. Ivan’s nickname morphs from “country boy” to “pretty boy” to “the outlaw” in just a short while. He is like Icarus, flying too close to the hot Caribbean sun. “I thought my wits and charm could get me out front,” Ivan concedes to his mom as he prepares to flee.', 'New, exciting musicals are hard to come by, and ', 'The Harder They Come', ' features a big cast with big beats — and big potential.', 'The Harder They Come', ' is at The Public Theater through April 9.

‘Drinking in America’ review — Andre Royo’s talent outshines a dated play,"Read our review of Eric Bogosian's play "", 'Drinking in America', ', starring Andre Royo of ', 'The Wire', ', now playing at the Minetta Lane Theatre through April 8.', 'Many Eric Bogosian titles feel tailored to 2023 audiences. ', 'Talk Radio', ' examines the creation of an entertainment persona, parasocial relationships, and far-right extremist violence. ', 'subUrbia', ' discusses the timeless dilemma of growing up, getting out, and getting your life together. But Bogosian’s ', 'Drinking in America', ', now at the ', 'Minetta Lane Theatre', ', has nothing new to say about substance use or its fallout; in fact, dated language hampers the show. The choice to produce it today is less a question of art for art’s sake than of art for the sake of profit.', 'Drinking in America stars the charismatic Andre Royo, best known for his turn on TV’s ', 'The Wire', '. He performs a series of monologues that all involve, to some extent, drug and alcohol use: He plays a talent agent dependent on cocaine to deal with Hollywood hotheads, a drunk man on the street with delusions of grandeur, a stony preacher who encourages his audience to “take a bottle, fill it up with gasoline, light it on fire, throw it into one of these abortion clinics.”', 'Royo, who has been ', 'sober for over a year', ', begins the show with a brief introduction to his adolescence in the Bronx (and was surprised that, at my performance, no one clapped at the borough’s mention). With the house lights still up, Royo’s transition into his first character is seamless, but further ones are more muddled.', 'Audiences unfamiliar with Bogosian’s solo plays may strive to make connections among the characters, some of whom may be one man’s alter ego or a voice in another’s head. They are connected most of all not by Mark Armstrong’s direction or Royo’s performance, but by Kristen Robinson’s carceral set, which evokes an apartment complex, a recording studio, and an asylum all at once in its stark simplicity.', 'The script, revised for this revival (Bogosian first performed the show in 1986), references culture war arguments still raging as much today as when Bogosian won the Drama Desk Award. It also nods to the playwright’s other work: The preacher, described as “The Law,” refers to Alan Berg, the Jewish shock jock whose murder by white supremacists became the focus of the film adaptation of ', 'Talk Radio', '. Perhaps this reference is meant to be tongue-in-cheek for theatregoers more familiar with Bogosian’s ', 'Succession', ' appearance than his written works, but it feels a bit smug.', 'The missive of ', 'Drinking in America', ' is unclear beyond “Don’t do drugs” or, rather, “Do drugs if you want, I guess.” It need not be a diatribe or a scared-straight lecture, but the revival reinforces its lack of a larger thesis. Minetta Lane is the theatrical home for Amazon’s Audible, and ', 'Drinking in America', ' is suitable as an audio drama to listen to on your phone.', 'Its current form showcases Royo’s talent and lets actors jot down monologues to add to their repertoire, but it doesn’t aspire to something more impactful.

The three 20somethings, all Asian adoptees, have a remarkably tough load: Their adopted mom is addicted to opioids, their dad was a victim of arson, and vicious birds are out to get them. Despite the heavy topics, Julia Izumi’s farcical tragedy ', 'Regretfully, So the Birds Are', ' is a joyful romp.', 'The playful world premiere — co-produced by ', 'Playwrights Horizons', ' and ', 'WP Theater', ' — is neatly structured into three acts that follow the three siblings as they renege on their three sibling pacts.', 'Illy’s solution to navigating her quarter-life crisis is to buy a piece of the sky. Mora sets off to find her birth mother, and feeble-minded Neel heads to Nebraska to listen to country music (he intended to go to Nashville).', ""The siblings' performances are the production’s biggest strength. Mora, played by Shannon Tyo, is the self-proclaimed “disaster older sister.” Tyo brings physical comedy to the role, and she spirals while clinging to her status as the favorite child. As Illy, Sasha Diamond dons a tweed lady jacket and a pussy bow blouse (costumes are by Alicia J. Austin) and plays the most buttoned-up sibling with verve."", 'Sky Smith shines as the feeble-minded Neel, whose sense of self changes when he discovers he is tone-deaf. The trio flails while their mom, Elinore (played with hilarity by Kristine Nielsen), gets high in jail.', 'Under the well-paced direction of Jenny Koons, the humor lands. Many scenes involve Gibson Frazier as Cam the Snowman, who enters the stage in a flurry of snowflakes and appears in a snowman cutout while doling out advice and fun facts. Frazier also portrays Cowman, a heroic rancher sporting not just one but two cowboy hats. A flock of colorful birds, puppeteered by the whole cast, also draws laughs.', 'The production design ups the farce with a cartoonish sky above a treehouse, a half-burned living room, and the snowman (scenic design is by You-Shin Chen). A recurring joke comes in the form of a glaring spotlight (lighting is by Stacey Derosier) each time one of the siblings yells, “Attention!”', 'The second act loses a bit of steam and gets increasingly improbable when Mora travels to Cambodia, but the 90-minute show remains highly entertaining.', 'The play does not offer the Whistler siblings, or the audience, a playbook for adulting, nor does it come down hard against adoption, as one might expect. Audiences who enjoyed ', 'MCC Theater’s ', 'Wolf Play', ' will enjoy ', 'Regretfully, So the Birds Are', ', as both creatively examine the complexities of adoptive identity.

'White Girl in Danger' review — this soap opera sendup brings the laughs,"Read our four-star review of ', 'White Girl in Danger', ', the latest musical from ', 'A Strange Loop', ' creator Michael R. Jackson that spoofs and celebrates soap operas.', 'White Girl in Danger', ' is Michael R. Jackson’s latest musical foray. The story-within-a-story takes place in Allwhite, a fictional universe infused with soap opera tropes and flairs for the melodramatic. Here, Keesha is a “Blackground” actor stuck in a loop of slave narratives and stories of police brutality. But when Keesha gets promoted to the Allwhite Best Friend character, she sees a pathway to landing a central storyline.', 'At the Allwhite high school, Keesha plays bestie to Megan, Maegan, and Meagan, a trio of white girls with myriad issues. Megan (Molly Hager) has a drinking problem, Maegen (Alyse Alan Louis) struggles with an eating disorder, and Meagan (Lauren Marcus) is a klutz with an abusive boyfriend (Eric William Morris). Keesha is the foil to their chaos. The Megans just want their band, Girlwhite, to take home the top prize at the upcoming Battle of the Bands, but Keesha is creeping in on their turf. Oh, and there’s a killer on the loose.', 'Like Jackson’s Tony Award-winning ', 'A Strange Loop', ', ', 'White Girl in Danger', ' is highly referential. It nods to soap operas, musicals, satires, thrillers, and even fantasy novels. It’s chock-full of Easter eggs for pop culture enthusiasts. It’s hard to catch them all, especially the ones stuffed into fast-paced songs. Under the direction of Lileana Blain-Cruz, the musical catapults through time and space swiftly.', 'The design helps to transport the audience through the wild ride of genres. The Allwhite high school is reminiscent of the ‘80s sitcom ', 'Saved By the Bell', ', with a Memphis-style design of zigzag walls and bright lockers by scenic designer Adam Rigg. At the annual “Anti-Allwhite Diamond charity fashion show for Blackground Representation Matters,” the actors don glittery gowns with shoulder pads (by costume designer Montana Levi Blanco), a nod to the long-running soap ', 'Dynasty', '. The raucous number “Let’s Party” mirrors house parties in ‘90s flicks, complete with pulsing lights (by Jen Schriever), grunge attire, and red Solo cups.', 'The ride of this three-hour musical is too long, especially considering Keesha reaches her outlined objectives by the end of Act 1. But she wants more — she wants to dismantle Allwhite supremacy and lift the Blackgrounds from oppression. The second act cascades into several more genres and hits hot-button issues, one after another. There is a big payoff, though, that brings the rambling story to a close. (It’s too bad some audience members in my row left at intermission and missed it.)', 'The performances are certainly worth sticking around for. As Keesha, Latoya Edwards is exacting and steadfast in achieving the character’s motives, whether she’s portraying a runaway enslaved person, a self-assured lawyer, or a seductive lesbian. As the storylines shift, Edwards seamlessly transitions and brings the audience along for the ride, full throttle.', 'Tarra Conner Jones delivers a standout performance as Nell Gibbs, Keesha’s mother who sacrifices her own plot to center her daughter’s. Throughout the musical, Nell takes on various roles in the Allwhite universe, from school lunch lady to nurse to the assistant district attorney to mammy. Her powerful pipes soar in several songs, particularly the 11 o’clock number “Why I Kill.” Jones elicits audience laughter with her physical comedy, even simple sidelong glances. Best of all, she fully embodies the character of a mother with a deep well of unconditional love, despite her daughter’s antics. As Keesha puts it: “You are the greatest Mom character of all time.”', 'Fans of ', 'A Strange Loop', ' will enjoy this jaunt through Jackson’s imagination. ', 'A Strange Loop', ' redefined the musical form, and ', 'White Girl in Danger', ' carries that torch forward and revises the soap opera to boot.

The 75-minute show, the latest stage production from Audible Theater, provides a lesson on how to navigate grief and offer support beyond platitudes.

In this bit, Kayne introduces himself to the audience and shares how he went from studying musical theatre at New York University to finding success as a comedian."", 'As a nod to Kayne’s background as a math and English tutor, the rest of the show takes the shape of an engaging lesson plan. Kayne uses two rolling whiteboards and a lectern to deliver lessons on phonetics, quantum physics, and history that all tie into the universal experience of bereavement. “Grief was not always so isolated,” he shares before diving into a lesson on how science increased lifespans and impacted the collective experience of loss.', 'The show is a meditation on existentialism — and it is painfully sad. Kayne carefully shepherds the audience into the heavy material and provides beats of silence for processing. After he shares what he says is the worst sentence in the world, “My son is dead,” he offers an opportunity for audience members to exit the theatre if they so choose.', 'Despite the topic, the charismatic Kayne finds moments of levity to lift the energy.

Ruhl immortalized their exchanges in the epistolary memoir "", 'Letters From Max', ', and she builds on that work with her new play of the same name, a flesh-and-blood tribute to her late friend.', 'Letters From Max', "" is the kind of play you're glad also exists in book form. Ruhl jam-packs her script with poems, letters, texts, and conversations between herself and Ritvo that invite deep reflection long after the show ends.

They're not so much exact imitations of Ruhl and Ritvo as they are interpreters of their emotional journeys. Nonetheless, the characters are named Sarah and Max, with the latter played by Ben Edelman and Zane Pais on alternating nights."", ""At my performance, Edelman brought charisma and swagger to Max, a perfect foil for Jessica Hecht's introspective Sarah. Pais was still on hand to play a few supporting roles and play live guitar music he composed himself. (When Pais is Max, Edelman does the same on the piano.)"", ""The play does lack a certain sense of drive — after all, we know from the get-go how it ends. Perhaps, though, that's intentional. By moving us slowly and gently through Sarah and Max's five-year story, letting us take our time to absorb their poetic correspondences, Ruhl keeps Ritvo alive a little longer."", 'Letters From Max', ' is at the Pershing Square Signature Center through March 19.

Iris is a wannabe actress who waits tables and has saved her tip money to see a shrink. She’s had plenty to discuss during two years of psychoanalysis, including that the story she’s told her husband about her Oklahoma upbringing is largely fiction. Her finest acting gig: Mrs. Brustein.', 'Five years into the marriage, cracks are showing. That Sidney sneers at Iris’s acting skills and derides her plans to do a TV commercial doesn’t help.

The road trip, Peg insists, will make for a refreshing switch from both their listless lives."", ""The expected U.S. landmark-gawking, father-daughter bonding, and well-meaning parental nagging all happen. But the title forewarns us these interactions will build to a tragedy.

They can’t move. After the initial shock, they’re not so bothered by that. “It’s weird, but I’m fine,” David, a filmmaker, tells his soon-to-be-ex boyfriend Jared (Sean Donovan). The brother and sister don’t seek help from anyone — not town officials, medical professionals, or tree surgeons.', 'So what’s next? Is it a show about accepting whatever life throws our way, no matter how bizarre? Is it the setup for an absurd existential outing? Is it a riff on ', 'Waiting for Godot', ', a meditation on finding one’s place or purpose in life, this time observed through the perspective of the tree mentioned in that play? Good questions.', '“Maybe we just needed to stop, you know?” says Sheila. “Maybe everything just needed to stop.” Maybe. But waiting for the play to branch into a coherent and compelling narrative proves to be an exercise in frustration. What emerges is a group portrait of odd-lot characters drawn to Sheila and David, or at least to what’s befallen them.', ""Among them is Baba, the sibs’ elderly Polish grandmother (Danusia Trevino). She comes prepared to keep them safe, including protecting them from wolves that prowl this neck of the woods. Baba sets up a tent and lights a campfire. She'll now live her life outside with her grandkids."", 'Meanwhile, obnoxiously self-obsessed Charlotte (Becky Yamamoto), Sheila’s longtime friend, presumably comes by to check on her pal.

Rectangular in shape and light pink. Very, very pink: Benjamin Moore’s Island Sunset Pink.” The platform is flanked with sequin-wrapped poles and topped with big, pillowy bubble letters that spell the show’s title.

Like a weak punch, there's plenty of momentum but no follow-through."", ""This theme extends to the play's end.

The friends culled the 90-minute play from more than 50 hours of dialogue between them over the course of about a year. With the help of an earpiece, Cuiffo recreates his side of the conversations live, complete with every utterance and sound of movement. It’s a challenging feat of synchronization, and the charming Cuiffo holds his own on stage. Cuiffo drives the energy forward with his genuine pleasure of performing magic tricks, many of which he’s likely performed for decades.', 'Hnath’s recorded voice plays along, asking questions about Cuiffo’s practiced magic performance and responding to his tricks with delight.

But that’s just spin. The 70-minute work is essentially an amusing but shapeless survey of what’s bugging the writer and star. There are so many things.', 'Quinn doesn’t exactly connect the dots between talking points. Ideas just rise up fleetingly and then recede, Whac-a-Mole-style. He starts by talking about the weather.

His daughter Patti has no respect for him. Neither does his other estranged daughter, Misty, who shows up out of the blue. And he has to resort to drug dealing for an extra cash flow, but a slick salesman he is not.', ""Norbert Leo Butz does a commendable job with the character, imbuing Jacob with a boyish, explosive energy and amusingly dad-level dance skills. He also benefits from the fact that Jacob is the one character we get the fullest portrait of. He's ambitious and enthusiastic but impulsive, and that gets the better of him in work (like when he blows his budget on expensive ingredients) and life (like his past extramarital affair, which resulted in Patti)."", ""But Stephens doesn't spend enough time digging into the consequences of any of that, leaving us with little reason to emotionally invest in Jacob. He instead gets distracted by the thinly drawn supporting characters, whom we're able to connect with even less. Case in point: a forced attempt at a romantic subplot between Misty and drab Google employee Jacob, spurred on by another character telling him to ask her out with no buildup as to why an attraction might grow between them in the first place."", ""That character, by the way, is Sarah, a grandmotherly figure who gets shoehorned into an even less believable romantic subplot with Jacob. (She's also a former nightclub regular and potentially clairvoyant, another two elements hardly explored.) The effortlessly magnetic Mary Beth Peil at least makes the part entertaining. Kevyn Morrow does the same for Marty, the cafe's namesake and landlord, giving the most natural performance within Neil Pepe's otherwise stilted direction. And Gizel Jiménez pours her heart into her two songs, stirring the emotions even though we don't quite know what we're supposed to feel."", 'Suffering from the opposite problem is Patti, whose Act 1 solo ""You Do Nothing"" — theoretically about how her lack of respect for Jacob leaves her no motivation to live up to his expectations — has the potential to have the most dramatic heft.

She dons mermaid leggings under mismatched, patterned maxi dresses, with jingling bangles and a smattering of random tattoos to complete the look — but that's hardly odd in New York.

That changes things. My mind immediately went to vampire — ""kids keep me young"" is a refrain of hers. Then she drawled out ""I loooooove baby boys"" in a slightly creepy way that set off a different alarm bell in my mind. My suspicions kept flip-flopping between supernatural and sexual throughout the opening scene.', ""Both those theories proved unfounded. So what worries are left? None, perhaps. Maybe Ashling's just a slightly eccentric woman with a great skincare routine. Maybe she's just the breath of fresh, Type-B air that Type-A Mary's household needs. Mary seems to go on a similar thought journey in the opening scene."", 'But I should mention here that Mary isn't perfect, either. The single mother is almost concerningly fixed on her six-year-old getting enough exercise and learning to entertain herself — you worry poor Lucy might grow up to feel isolated or dysmorphic. Mary also confesses to Ashling, ""I never felt anger in my life until I had her."" But that's not mutually exclusive with love — isn't turmoil, too, just a normal part of motherhood that goes unspoken? Perhaps.

But it's the ugly parts of them that come to light, and only worsen, in each other's presence."", 'That's where the horror subtly comes in — Ashling's many acts that anger Mary include mostly benign things like making chicken soup or bringing Lucy gifts. We still might find ourselves siding against Mary for condeming them for no apparent reason, up until the end, when Mary powerfully reminds us that ""because I asked you not to"" is a full sentence and a message that deserves respect.', ""Schmidt's apparent point is that any seemingly ordinary instinct — be it a child's or adult's — is enough to deem a person unfit for your home or your life.

We know Peter and his wife have just had a baby and decided they no longer want their adopted son. We know they put an ad online saying the boy is “eager to please.” We know he refers to the child as “Pete Junior,” but he stills plans to desert him with strangers.', 'When Robin’s wife Ash (Esco Jouléy), a no-nonsense boxer, arrives home and promptly punches Peter in the face, we all but cheer.

But Ash and Ryan find Robin’s choice just as inappropriate as Peter’s. “This is grown up? Getting a child from Yahoo?” Ash spits before they bond with the boy.', ""Wolf is an invention of the boy's own mind, a persona created to protect himself from harm.

The violence of the state, its flawed adoption system and hidden fallout, manifests through Ash and Ryan’s boxing, choreographed by fight director Hannah “Rock” Roccisano. Wolf and the audience, meanwhile, take refuge in You-Shin Chen’s scenic design, a cluttered chaos of play objects. In this bubble, a child’s imagination both comforts and charms, concealing the sharp realities that pierce the plush surroundings.', 'Wolf is a separate entity from the puppet he sometimes connects with, a papier-mâché creature designed by Amanda Villalobos. Jung first describes him in the script as a “boy doll,” and Wolf is his puppeteer.', 'The Jeenu puppet is not endowed with overflowing life and spirit. But this choice is perhaps intentional: None of the characters in ', 'Wolf Play', ' see Jeenu as a real child. Peter has failed in his actions and his guilt; Robin is obsessed with getting motherhood right and making sure others know it; and Ash and Ryan are both too concerned with their own images of power and control to make space for another person to grow. Only when Ash enters does Wolf’s puppet seem enraptured with a more lifelike gaze.', 'While the life imbued in the puppet feels at times debatable, its death knell is not.

Stevie Walker-Webb directs a Greek chorus of actors who move as one to guide Ulysses onward as his head fills with water and he struggles to remember his bearings. Adrienne C. Moore and Lance Coadie Williams anchor the chorus, gliding from role to role with ease and grounding the heart of the piece as Artez — the proud Grand Marshall in the Second Line parade — and Alsendra, a couple taking refuge on the roof of their home during a Noah’s Ark-scale flood.', 'UptownWorks, the production company that provided sound design, plays audio of stranded storm survivors neglected by the U.S. government in transition to the flood setting, cementing a link between the Biblical stories of old and climate disasters of today. Most audiences would absorb this link without further instruction, but Artez and Alsendra then explain that God began “spitting curses on the Earth” since the murders of Malcom X and President Kennedy and has been crying 40 days and nights since the assassination of Dr. King.', 'This rather abrupt tonal shift from the subtle to the heavy-handed characterizes the main structural issue with ', 'black odyssey', ': The play is at times captivating and clever, but it is more interested in reveling in its own cleverness than in seeing its choices through. The unevenness makes Gardley’s script feel a little corny in its reliance on on-the-nose pronouncements; Ulysses welcomes us back from intermission with a cringe-worthy choral proclamation: “American Dream was a nightmare programmed to keep me asleep and broke. But I got news: I’m woke.”', 'The framing of the Greek gods playing chess with the lives of men guides ', 'black odyssey', ' through its highs and lows, and the performances all soar even as the script sours. Jimonn Cole’s bitter Paw Sidin (Poseidon) is a worthy antagonist whose earned ire provides a thought-provoking conflict, while Harriett D. Foy charms and enchants as Aunt Tina (Athena).', 'The dark comedy provides indulgent updates on Greek mythological figures that delight even as Ulysses despairs: The prophet Tiresias is now “Superfy,” shepherding Ulysses through trials with his disco moves. The Sirens threatening to shipwreck Ulysses now embody Diana Ross, Tina Turner, and James Brown, crooning and kicking in costume designer Kindall Almond’s silver sequins as the audience howls with laughter. Moore’s soul food monologue as Circe is, to pardon the pun, downright delicious.', 'Tẹmídayọ Amay is also an endearing and adorable treat as the 10-year-old Benevolence, a flood survivor who likes magic, stories, and freeze tag. Gardley and Walker-Webb don’t give the character nearly enough to do, and their near-omniscient presence sometime distracts from a given stage picture. An eventual reveal on the nature of their character doesn’t make up for a lack of development, especially with the gifted Amay proving they can handle more intricate work.', 'Despite the performances, ', 'black odyssey', '’s central message that the worst of your offenses will be pardoned by the best of your ancestors is a confounding one — especially when we learn of Ulysses’s offense — that muddies the waters of an otherwise gorgeous production.', 'black odyssey', ' is at Classic Stage Company through March 26.

'A Bright New Boise' review — unpacking big questions in a big-box store,"Read our review of Samuel D. Hunter's Obie Award-winning play "", 'A Bright New Boise', ', now making its Off-Broadway debut with Signature Theatre through March 12.', 'In ', 'A Bright New Boise', ', playwright Samuel D. Hunter turns the cheerless break room of a big-box arts-and-crafts superstore into a setting to explore big ideas about faith and family. While those notions are individually intriguing, they don’t cohere into a collective impact in this work first seen off-off Broadway in 2010.', 'The drama revolves around seemingly mild-mannered, 30something Will (Peter Mark Kendall), newly transplanted to Boise from a small community in northern Idaho. We meet him during a Hobby Lobby job interview with Pauline (Eva Kaminsky), a no-B.S. manager who’s worked overtime to make her store a success. Pauline hires Will on the spot even though he’s vague about personal questions on the application. Why’d he leave that earlier job off his resume? No emergency contact? What’s up with that?', 'Early on, Will reveals one reason he’s come to Boise – and this store – after meeting Alex (Ignacio Diaz-Silverio), a 17-year-old coworker who was adopted as a baby by a local couple. Petulant Alex removes his earphones just long enough to tell Will to buzz off. But that’s 180 degrees from Will’s desires – and there’s a reason why.', 'While Will seeks to connect with Alex, he’s also running from his past. After a series of clunky, hesitating half-hints, we discover Will’s association with a cult-like church whose leader caused the death of a young follower named Daniel. A late scene underlines the similarities between Daniel and Alex, repeating what has already been said.', 'Will’s link to the infamous church comes out thanks to Alex’s protective older adoptive brother Leroy (Angus O’Brien), a visual artist who fashions graphic tees when he’s not stocking shelves at Hobby Lobby. Also on hand is Anna (Anna Baryshnikov), a sensitive and reserved coworker who hides in the aisles at closing time so she can stay after hours to read alone in the break room.', 'In a convenient twist, Will similarly hides out so he can write his blog, a work that reveals his religious beliefs. Will regularly summons the rapture – “Now. Now. Now.” Alex, meanwhile, often talks about killing himself.nIt’s just a matter of time before this five-character collision turns messy. Hunter’s message, which seems to be about who Will is and who he wants to be for Alex, ends up more murky than bright.', 'Director Oliver Butler’s staging of Hunter’s breakthrough play is uniformly well-acted. It simmers with subtle unease. Per the script, the break room TV runs nonstop images of either gross surgeries or two men droning on. You can’t catch a break in this place rendered and lit in evocative detail by set designer Wilson Chin and lighting designer Jen Schriever.', 'It’s easy to appreciate that ', 'A Bright New Boise', ' is by the same author of later plays like ', 'The Whale', ' and ', 'A Case for the Existence of God', ' — and not just because the setting is Hunter’s home state of Idaho. He’s always drawn to characters trying to connect and finds drama in the everyday.

Pious Esther, for one, sneaks books from the local library, letting the tales of ', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', ' and ', 'Little Women', ' shape her view of a life beyond Brooklyn.', 'Scenic designer Marion Williams turns a Williamsburg apartment into a wall of open books, a domineering structure that almost resembles a memorial. And Ziegler’s script, in the hands of director Barry Edelstein, simultaneously wants to eviscerate the image of the Jewish male novelist and justify his arrogance, to tell us he only whines because he has something worth whining about.', 'The Wanderers', ' follows Abe (Eddie Kaye Thomas), a secular Jewish novelist who has found critical acclaim writing about generational trauma. He fears he had not revealed enough of himself in his earlier novels and that now, as his children grow and his marriage crumbles, he will reveal too much with his next. Like Roth, he wants to both hide and unfold himself through his books, ultimately pursuing an emotional affair when he believes his wife no longer understands the aspirations of his capital-L Literature.', 'His wife, Sophie (Sarah Cooper), is also a writer, though her output has been stymied by her two children and their endless demands on her time. Abe all but admits he sees her writing as less important than his and that their children prefer her in charge. Abe and Sophie began dating as teenagers, their mothers lifelong best friends, but Abe is falling head over keyboard for Julia Cheever (Katie Holmes), a famous actress who began emailing him after attending one of his book readings.', ""Holmes's casting as a heightened version of herself (minus the email affair) is the golden goose for "", 'The Wanderers', ', a play most concerned with people obsessing over how others perceive them. Holmes’s Julia is happy to be a walking muse, a lightbulb that turns on whenever Abe needs her, brightening the story with her unassuming charm.', 'Consumed by his writing, his newfound pursuit of Julia, and unresolved grief over his parents and childhood, Abe no longer sees Sophie as a person. Neither does the script. We don’t know much about her writing, her relationship to her children, or her opinions on her parents beyond petty arguments. She both refutes and agrees with Abe’s offhanded accusation that she isn’t truly Jewish because of her mixed heritage; this internal conflict for a Black Jewish woman, a character we rarely see on stage, deserves as much time as Abe’s self-righteous emails. Disparaging Cooper’s wooden performance feels unfair in the face of her underwritten character.', 'Throughout the modern scenes of a marriage, ', 'The Wanderers', ' also explores the lives of Schmuli (Dave Klasko) and Esther (Lucy Freyer), a young Satmar Hasidic couple whose newlywed life is both titillating and suffocating. As members of one of the most secluded Hasidic sects in Judaism, Schmuli and Esther rarely interact with non-Jews and avoid things like computers or even the radio. Not all the details about Satmar life are correct, but the play captures the tension between Esther’s love of her religious and cultural life and her desire to explore past its boundaries.', 'Klasko’s Schmuli, endearing until the moment he isn’t, has spent a lifetime associating manhood with the capacity to control. Klasko’s sharp and fluid Yiddish is a stark contrast to Freyer’s, which jumbles in her mouth. The couple’s story is more engaging than Abe and Sophie’s, though an attempt to connect Sophie and Esther through a traumatic experience doesn’t feel supported by the text or performances.', 'The Wanderers', ' feels purposely manufactured for the audience who will come see it: Older, largely upper class, largely secular Jewish patrons. The play does not feel like a vehicle of cultural representation, but one the creative team can market to a reliable theatregoing audience without much effort.', 'Elements of the story — deception of a loved one, parasocial relationships, whether we can be someone outside the influence of our parents — are worthy facets of a family drama. But their execution — hokey Klezmer scene transition music and Hebrew phrases, thrown in at the ends of conversations for no purpose beyond showing that the playwright knows them — are faulty. The play does not feel like an artistic exploration of the search for meaning in the lives of people grappling with personal and familial failures.

The three stars' repeated interlocking pinkies is practically the only evidence of the pals’ bond. That’s one reason the show is a problem child."", ""Told in reverse chronology, George Furth's story is drawn from a play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, and it goes from bitter to sweet.

The spare residential set by Soutra Gilmour, who also designed groovy period costumes, is neutral enough to be anywhere, anytime. Musicians are tucked into an upstairs room.', 'Director Maria Friedman’s staging, which premiered in London in 2012 before runs in Tokyo, Boston, and now New York, is bookended by a concept that turns the musical into a memory piece. Franklin Shepard (Groff), an A-list but miserable movie producer and composer, clutches the script of an old work. Stock still, he stands facing the audience. He cranks his head right, and then left. He’s searching. For dashed dreams? Drowned friendships? His black-and-white outfit looks right for a party. Or a funeral.', 'A song lyric asks “How did you get to be here?” The answer emerges bit by bit.

Mary’s successful career as an author dries up, and she sinks into the bottle.', 'The story’s consideration of the fragility of friendships stands out. Otherwise it’s filled with showbiz go-to storylines: idealism corrupted by cash, fidelity abandoned for cheating, allegiances trumped by ambition. Frank’s marriage to Beth (Katie Rose Clarke) is essentially over before it begins. It falls victim to Frank’s neediness and roving eye, along with enticements by Gussie Carnegie (Krystal Joy Brown), who plays a series of roles in his life — star of the show he and Charley co-write, mistress, wife, and soon-to-be-ex-spouse.', 'Sondheim is perennially popular on NYC stages.

'the bandaged place' review — moving new play captures the messiness of trauma and healing,"To get right to the point: Harrison David Rivers's "", 'the bandaged place', ' has no cuts or holes that need bandaging up. Every plot point, every character, every moment in this nearly perfect new play, presented by ', 'Roundabout Underground', ', has been stitched together perfectly. It will make your heart bleed in many different ways; it is a thoughtful and excellent meditation on the long and winding road to healing.', ""The story centers on a dancer named Jonah, who just got out of a physically and emotionally abusive relationship. And yet, Ruben, his ex, manages to slink back into his life, knowing Jonah can't resist — restraining order be damned. Jonah is better at pushing away his grandmother Geraldine and eight-year-old daughter Ella, partly out of shame and partly as a continuation of a broken family cycle. His grandmother had pushed away his mother, who then abandoned him in childhood."", ""It's a dense plot for only five characters (Sam, Jonah's new lover, adds yet another layer and rounds out the count), but a sublime cast, bolstered by clear writing, tackle it with ease. Stephanie Berry, a not-so-hidden gem of the Off-Broadway scene, mines every depth of Geraldine as she actively works to make up for past mistakes with her daughter. She acts as a great foil to Jhardon DiShon Milton's volatile Jonah, who's still learning to do that; Phoenix Noelle (at the performance I attended) rounded out the family as Ella with poise. Separately, as Sam, the endearing Jake Ryan Lozano perfectly foiled Anthony Lee Medina, who brought a stomach-turning blend of sadism and sexiness to Ruben."", 'Every bit of their dialogue feels not only character-appropriate, but legitimately authentic. Rivers offsets Ella's precociousness, for example, with an adorably naive declaration of how relationships work: ""Everyone knows about boyfriends, Nana. Almost all the girls in my class have one."" That line is part of an expertly crafted scene of two conversations happening in parallel: Geraldine explains Ruben and Jonah's history in childlike terms, while Jonah does the same for Sam in adult terms. (', 'the bandaged place', ' may trigger those sensitive to abuse, including a terrifying moment of violence that is heard but, mercifully, unseen.)', ""Rivers seemingly leaves no detail of his play unconsidered. One scene shows Ruben gifting a necklace to Jonah, an effective metaphor for the hold Ruben has on him, even when he's absent. And there was a moment, just as I was thinking that Ruben hadn't been on stage for a while, when he suddenly appears. Whether this pacing was deliberate or not, it evidenced how trauma has a way of creeping back up just when you think it's gone."", ""Luckily, there are moments of lightness too, such as the tender courtship between Sam and Jonah that almost seems too perfect to be true. There's also a recurring theme of dance as a means of catharsis: From struggling to dance at the beginning as his memories (and a wounded knee, both courtesy of Ruben), paralyze him, Jonah makes progress by goofily dancing with Sam, and has a final breakthrough via a fierce pas de deux that depicts his and Ruben's entire journey. (The excellent choreography is by Tislarm Bouie.)"", 'Though ', 'the bandaged place', "" shows Jonah's considerable progress toward healing, the play avoids a neatly tied-up ending. Rivers doesn't suggest that Jonah and Sam will live happily ever after, or that Ruben will never reappear, or that Jonah and his family have fully patched up their troubles; doing so would have undermined the entire story.

That show dangerously romanticized its characters in the name of nostalgia for young love and innocence, and I feared this show would do the same.', ""My fears, luckily, proved unfounded. Bess Wohl's play includes romance, but sentimental and forgiving it is not. It's clear from the start that we're not supposed to root for the unnamed young lovers. Fear for them, perhaps — they are terrifyingly naive and easily seduced, and not just by each other."", ""It's almost too clear, in fact; the girl states her address as Hitler Street, which would be too on-the-nose if not for the fact that that street, and the title camp itself, was a real place on Long Island in the pre-World War II years. The German American Bund, a pro-Nazi group, operated Camp Siegfried and others to bring young Americans into the fold, with the end goal of them giving birth to yet another generation of Nazis."", ""The boy and girl's relationship in Wohl's play is thus contrived. And for a while, the plan works: Were it not for the fog of fascism choking them, their romps in the idyllic greenery (set design is by Brett J. Banakis) would almost seem sweet."", 'Well, mostly. The boy (Johnny Berchtold), the ""runt"" of his family with an inferiority complex, has a nagging habit of calling the girl ""dummy."" The girl (Lily McInerny), soft-spoken and fearful, gets off on calling him evil. There's a sinister streak to their relationship that we know will doom it: She's fascinated by his machismo until he uses it against her. He's fascinated by her hidden power until it threatens his own.', ""That power comes out in a scene, the play's strongest, where the girl is delivering a speech in German. Unsure at first, she gradually gains confidence until her final sentences are a powerful, desperate cry. But there's fear in her eyes as she seems to realize the horror of what she's saying, but it's too late to stop. She's like a swimmer caught in a rip tide, whose only options are to drown or hope to be pushed out eventually."", 'But that scene exposes a disconnect in ', 'Camp Siegfried', "". It's the only time where Nazism motivates a character's actions. the The couple each already have a viciousness (and in the boy's case, his hypercritical Nazi family) that perhaps predisposes them to Nazism, not the other way around. It's not really about how evils like Nazism subtly warp people; it's just a cautionary tale about a toxic relationship."", 'Wohl is trying to craft a metaphor: Falling for fascism is its own kind of toxic relationship. ""Anyone can fall into anything, really. Anyone can be seduced,"" the girl says at the end, a rather unsubtle announcement of the play's theme.

She's naturally skeptical when Sayet announces plans to study Shakespeare in London — Sayet insists she's using the Bard to present the Native experience to those who wouldn't otherwise listen, but her mother initially thinks Sayet is forsaking her tribe and her culture. Though Sayet finds unexpected connection with an ancestor across the ocean, she eventually starts to wonder, well, where she belongs."", 'Sayet indicates in program notes that ', 'Where We Belong', ' was never meant to be a play.

But this "", 'Vineyard Theatre', "" production, while it might make an absorbing novel, doesn't quite thrill as theatre, feeling less like a journey through choppy waters and more like a steady cruise."", 'The play opens with Sandra (Marjan Neshat) relaying a conversation with Ethan, her best friend, in which he says: ""“I feel like disappearing from my life."" And sure enough, Ethan travels to Mexico and doesn't come back. He's about all she has: She's separated from her husband and blows up most opportunities to rekindle things, and she often turns to drink immediately after insisting she shouldn't. Keeping with that self-destructive streak, she flies solo to Mexico to look for Ethan even though an (admittedly patronizing) FBI agent is on the case.', ""While there, she encounters a few people that, this being a detective story, we're inclined to suspect: namely, a friendly gay Manhattanite named Beauford, and an alluring half-Italian man named Luca, with whom Sandra begins an affair.

'Catch as Catch Can' review — expertly acted play turns the family drama on its head,"Unhappy families are unhappy in their own way, so it’s long been said. In her conceptually ambitious and expertly acted play, ', 'Catch as Catch Can', ', Mia Chung takes that time-honored trope and puts her own theatrical stamp on it. Bottom line, she doubles down.', 'Three actors play six characters – each an adult child and one of their parents — jumping genders and generations while they’re at it. In director Daniel Aukin’s staging at ', 'Playwrights Horizons', ', a trio of Asian actors play the characters who, the script notes, are white. This production uses a newly revised script following a Page 73 presentation in 2018.', ""We meet the Italian American Lavecchias and the Irish American Phelans, working-class New England neighbors. At lights up Theresa Phelan (Rob Yang) and Roberta Lavecchia (Jon Norman Schneider) sip tea and gab about the far-off royal family before turning their attention to their own. Theresa’s son Tim (Yang) is back from California and he's engaged – to Mingjin, a Korean-American architect."", 'Roberta’s son Robbie (Schneider), who lives with his folks, is still reeling from a divorce from his Chinese wife. Meanwhile, Roberta’s daughter Daniela (Cindy Cheung, who also plays her father, Lon), appears to be eagerly anticipating her boyfriend’s proposal.', 'The next 14 scenes, separated by blackouts, show how just about everything that appeared to be true in that first exchange isn’t, thanks to misinterpretations or flat-out deceptions.', 'It begs the question: Can you ever really know somebody and trust what they’re saying? Or, for that matter, oneself? Deep into the play Chung spells this out explicitly when Tim asks Robbie:  “D’you know who you are … d’you like who you are? … I’ve no idea who I am.”', 'Parent-child doubling automatically sets the stage for blurred lines and potentially meaty meditations on personal identity, ancestry, and how apples don’t – and do – fall far from the tree when it comes to ingrained attitudes. Chung’s casting concept doesn’t break new ground, but she’s created six distinct characters who are fun to hang out with – until they’re not.', 'An abrupt shift occurs roughly midway into this 105-minute, intermission-free presentation. That’s the moment Tim shares a disturbing revelation about Mingjin with Daniela that changes everything about how other characters – and the audience – respond to him.', 'It also changes the tenor of the play from mostly easygoing and light and to sobering and sad. Sure, families can turn on a dime. But at this point, the story’s focus on a man bent on self-harm is what’s significant, not casting conceits.', 'Through it all, the actors prove themselves marvelous multitaskers as they toggle between their roles – sometimes in the blink of an eye. An extended scene wrapped around a Christmas gathering is a prime example of skillful shifting. Thanks to their deft and distinct characterizations, we always know exactly who’s who.', 'Less clear is just how much Chung’s story gains from the dual casting. In terms of this all-Asian cast, an ethnically charged exchange about Mingjin between Roberta (“They’re built different”) and Theresa (“She’s like a little doll”) lands with more sting because of it.', 'Is ', 'Catch as Catch Can', ' more interesting and satisfying for the actors than for the audience? Mileage may vary. Still, watching actors instantly become other people without any physical change or costume shift reminds that theatre allows us to tell stories in a way that can’t be done elsewhere.', 'Catch as Catch Can', ' is at Playwrights Horizons through November 20.

After regaling a high school tour group (read: the audience) with her take on ', 'The Crucible', ' in ', 'Becky Nurse of Salem', ""'s spellbinding opening scene, she's seen lamenting to the bartender Bob (Bernard White) that she hates her job. As luck would have it, she gets fired."", ""But Becky also has a depressed granddaughter to care for, an opioid addiction to feed, and a decades-old crush on the married Bob she can't shake. So what's a downtrodden woman in the land of the Salem Witch Trials to do? Seek out some magic, of course, with the help of a local witch (Candy Buckley)."", ""Becky, for the record, doesn't even fully believe in witchcraft. But she is the distant descendant of Rebecca Nurse, one of the 19 people hanged during the Witch Trials. She takes that role very seriously at and beyond the museum, reminding any captive audience she can get that Rebecca was innocent, "", 'The Crucible', ' incorrectly paints only its women as villains when John Proctor was just as flawed, and we're still telling the history of ""witches"" wrong.', 'Indeed, ', 'The Crucible', "", she also notes, is an allegory not only for the McCarthy era, but for Arthur Miller's lust for Marilyn Monroe and the guilt he felt for having it. (That's true, and it partly inspired Ruhl to write this play.) Casting her, the unknowing seductress, as the witchy antagonist Abigail and himself as the ultimately righteous John Proctor not only assuaged his guilt, but ended up shaping the way we understand the witch trials."", 'So Ruhl is essentially trying to reshape our understanding by way of Becky. She takes ', 'The Crucible', ' to task alongside the way society, including other women, denounces those who dare to feel to the extreme and do something about it.', 'Though heavy-handedly delivered, her parallels between the Salem Witch Trials and contemporary sexism are astute. Rebecca was wrongly condemned for being a witch. Becky is fired, rejected, condescended to, and even jailed for being, one might say, a bitch — that is, an imperfect, loudmouthed, passionate, angry woman just trying to find a little hope.', 'And ironically Becky is on the chopping block for everything but witchcraft. This point serves as a reminder that neither historical nor current witch hunts were ever about the supernatural, but about the very natural experience of being a woman with power.', ""O'Connell, a veritable force of nature in every part she plays, is no different in this one. It's rare to see such complexity as Becky's in an older character, and O'Connell's total commitment to every facet of her volatile personality — at turns blustering, vulnerable, sardonic, and seductive — casts a spell that almost makes us forget the play's choppy pacing and underdeveloped addiction subplot."", ""O'Connell, a fine supporting cast, and some whimsical lighting by Barbara Samuels make the flawed "", 'Becky Nurse of Salem', ' enchanting.

A lot of things are redacted in ', 'Exegesis', "" besides the church's name — the last names of every character, for one, in the church bulletin we're provided alongside the show's regular program. It's the first indication that there's a sinister thread lurking beneath this comedy at the "", 'Claire Tow Theater', '.', ""There are actually multiple dark threads, though most aren't redaction-worthy. All four members of the church's youth group, plus its leader, are grappling with something, and they perhaps hope religion will provide them respite, if not quite salvation. For the popular Addie, it's anorexia; the shy Beatrice, bulimia and friction with her mom. Swaggering Brian's sense of self-assurance is more fragile than it looks, and Chris can't cope with his alcoholic dad's absence."", 'The youth group is their safe haven, however imperfect, with the 30something youth pastor Kat as a de facto parental figure they can seek support from. In theory.', ""It quickly becomes evident that Kat silently wants Chris, who, being an impressionable 18-year-old that deeply trusts her, resists little. Kat takes her ever-growing sexual frustration out on the rest of the youth group. Addie, Chris's girlfriend, and Beatrice, who isn't necessarily crushing on Chris but is enamored by the fact that he pays any attention to her at all, especially become collateral damage in Kat's abuse of power."", ""Now the redactions make more sense. This isn't just a play about teenagers turning to faith to find their way — Jonas is subtly making us look at sexual abuse in the church. The issue likely brings to mind older male priests and young children, with multiple such cases making headlines in recent years (and long before that — this show, for one, begins in 1995). But "", 'Your Own Personal Exegesis', "" is a reminder that the face of abuse can be young, warm, and of any denomination. It's no less abuse."", ""It's terrifyingly clever, especially because centering "", 'Your Own Personal Exegesis', "" primarily on older teens also allows the play to still function effectively as a comedy. Unlike young children, they're old enough to be aware and wary of the world, so we can chuckle at the perfectly innocent romantic endeavors and interactions that transpire separately from the central conflict. These are awkward, hormonal teenagers nursing crushes in a church basement — it's a situation ripe for comedy, so much that the dark stuff still manages to creep up on us even though we know it's coming."", 'Plus, the action unfolds as the youth group prepares for events like a dance-a-thon and a passion play (in which the story of the married Bathsheba and lustful David — note the parallel — is set in the Vietnam War era), and we get to see the increasingly sophisticated fruits of all their efforts. A spirited dance sequence to The Cardigans' ""Lovefool"" is particularly joy-inducing. It's also the first moment Kat and Chris openly exhibit a whiff of tension. This mingling of the sacred and profane defines the show up to its ambiguous and unsettling end.', ""Annie Tippe gracefully directs the show's many moving parts, and the cast plays teenage insecurity well, if borderline caricatureish at times. Cole Doman, as Chris, strikes a particularly compelling balance between lax-bro thickheadedness and sincere desire to be something more. As Kat, Hannah Cabell is excellent at being disarming until she isn't. Mia Pak (Addie), Annie Fang (Beatrice), and Savidu Geevaratne (Brian) complement each other well, though I'd have loved to see consistently more of them — their plot lines, especially Brian's, fade in and out, even as a turning point in the play hinges on their presence."", 'A church may not be the best place to experience a sexual awakening or a fall from grace.

He hopes to bring his son back to California to work with him at his laundry.', 'That won’t be easy. In the spring of 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned Chinese people from coming to America. Gee’s interview ends and the scene shifts forward in time to Taishan. Gee’s demeanor has done a 180-degree turn. No longer meek and mild, he’s calculating and in control. Was everything he told officials a lie? Seems so.', 'He’s making a deal with no-nonsense Low (Amy Kim Waschke) in order to bring her teenage son, Moon Gyet, (Eric Yang) to San Francisco as his own son. Defying the law carries high risk and a steep price.

The plot goes thus: A royal family arrives in Paris and, by happenstance, cross paths with an ordinary married couple there, and they encourage each other to make their dreams a reality.', 'All involved are chasing some kind of desire: King Belenus (Terrence Mann) wants to rekindle his love with his distant wife, Queen Roksana (Karine Plantadit), who first wants him to change. Their daughter Tooba (Gaby Diaz) wants to escape her arranged marriage to a count and marry the Parisian bellboy Jacques (Ryan Steele). Meanwhile, the Parisian watchmaker Henri (Ryan VanDenBoom) achieves his dream of designing jewelry thanks to a commission from Belenus, but his wife, Camille (Hannah Cruz), feels left in the lurch, unable to fulfill her own dream of becoming a pianist.', 'It's a thin plot, but the nuanced contemporary choreography makes it feel 10 times richer.

In other words, ', 'american (tele)visions', ' is a lot.', ""Victor I. Cazares's play opens up at Walmart, as an undocumented Mexican family do their weekly shopping together. The tomboy daughter Erica (Blanca “b” Norwood) is in the boys’ toys aisle, the closeted gay son Alejandro (Clew) in the guns aisle, the father Octavio (Raúl Castillo) in the television aisle, and the mother Maria (Elia Monte-Brown) running around the store buying food and cleaning supplies for her family."", 'Erica narrates the story, categorizing her family not as people but as a collection of objects. “We are the things we make,” she says. “My father is a television.” But it’s not just because of overconsumption. The family lives in a trailer and works in factories, making chain-link fences and mobile homes. Their only mental escape from the drudgery is the television. Erica repeats those phrases, such as “my father is a television” and “my brother Alejandro is an unlabeled VHS cassette tape,” likely because those who are poor and undocumented, who perform the labor that Americans refuse to do, are never given an identity. It’s a poignant metaphor, rife with possibility.', 'Unfortunately, ', 'american (tele)visions', ' never give the characters personalities or growth beyond the objects they are associated with, leaving them one-dimensional and archetypes of the fallen American dream.american (tele)visions goes back-and-forth through time, slowly unfolding the story of a family who comes to the country with hope, but is eventually torn apart by tragedy. The narrative propulsion of the play comes not from the characters developing or growing or persevering, but through them (and the audience) discovering each other’s secrets.', 'The central disruption to the family is that Alejandro is gay and had a Vietnamese lover named Jesse. The narrative potential of Alejandro having a lover who is also an immigrant is never fully explored besides an ill-conceived joke about boat people. And the confounding decision to have Alejandro and Jesse be played by the same actor (Clew, who has trouble differentiating either character in their performance) means both characters are never anything more than tokens of gay suffering or prejudice. This is most troubling in the character of Jesse, who now lives with the family for an unexplained reason and mostly serves as a helper to them. The racial implication of casting an Asian man as a passive assistant is troubling.', ""Elia Monte-Brown and Ryan J. Haddad (as Erica’s best friend Jeremy, who is also closeted) are the most adept at navigating the show's many tonal shifts, able to quickly switch from pathos to camp.

Together, the two acts aim to show how his enterprising nature, once an asset, became his downfall when the public finally dared to defy him.', 'Hare is clearly inspired by ', 'The Power Broker', ', Robert Caro's incendiary 1977 biography that qualified Moses's many achievements with assertions that he used discriminatory and careless methods. (Many low-income ""slums"" Moses targeted for ""cleanup"" had populations of color.) Hare's play doesn't suggest that so much as knock audiences over the head with it, with lines like ""Nowadays people don’t want to be told how to live, they want to choose how to live. And they have that right"" and ""You’re no different from anyone else, Mr Moses.

That's even true of Moses, who mostly condescends to the women on stage and off, and lists off his achievements (""achievements,"" if you will) as though dictating a textbook entry: ""Countless slums destroyed, tenements gone, to be replaced by efficient, clean housing blocks, pleasing to the eye and hygienic for the purpose of living.""', ""Fiennes manages to find the shades of emotion in a Moses written as little but bullish.

'I'm Revolting' review — dark comedy about cancer crackles with a superb cast,"There are certain places that, at first glance, don't exactly scream ""comedy."" The gallows.The White House. A Neo-Nazi meeting. The end of the world. And yet, playwrights have not only set shows at each of these places, but received acclaim and awards for doing so. Gracie Gardner, in her Off-Broadway-debut play', ""I'm Revolting"", ',adds ""skin cancer clinic"" to that list. Whether she wins any awards for it has yet to be seen (she already has a Relentless Award, among others, for her show', 'PussySludge', ""), but masterful acting and direction makeI'm Revoltingwell worth a trip to the "", 'Linda Gross Theater', '.', 'The show's 90 minutes (which fly, thanks to Knud Adams's lively direction) are set entirely in the waiting room of the clinic. It's ""not the famous one"" — that would be Memorial Sloan-Kettering — not that it matters much, as both have three stars on Yelp. What emerges from there is a fresh take on the slice-of-life drama, with little capital-A Action but expertly rendered character studies. Subtle parallels emerge between the diverse ensemble members as they share (and eavesdrop on) their stories, having nothing else to do during a painstaking day of waiting.', ""We meet a total of nine characters: one is there for a routine check-in, three for outpatient surgery, and three for moral support, however bad they are at giving it. The remaining pair are doctors, floating in and out with news good and bad. I'm Revoltinghas put together a stellar cast for these characters, with spectacular ensemble work across the board. Alicia Pilgrim is a standout as Reggie, a 19-year-old whose obsession with looks reveals deeper insecurities, and Gabby Beans hits every comic note as her well-meaning but workaholic sister Anna. Patrick Vaill, known for playing Jud Fry in"", 'Oklahoma!', ', brings a similar brooding energy to Toby, a depressed millennial whose mother Paula (Laura Esterman), a holistic medicine devotee, has guilted him into thinking he brought his diseaseon himself.', ""Flying largely under the radar until the play's second half are Jordan (Glenn Fitzgerald) and Liane (Emily Cass McDonnell), an unhappily married couple driven apart by Liane's cancer. Clyde (Peter Gerety), an eccentric veteran of the clinic visiting alone, rounds out the waiting-room party, providing wanted and unwanted wisdom to the newcomers. Patrice Johnson Chevannes and Bartley Booz, as the veteran doctor Denise and the young resident Jonathan, are largely one-note, but they get to showcase more depth in the poignant, if abrupt, final scene."", ""Gardner, who is also an EMT, sports her medical knowledge outright with some jargon here and there. But more subtly, her lived experience is likely what makesI'm Revoltingfeel so authentic even in its zaniest moments, like when Paula pulls out her singing bowls for a holistic healing session in the middle of the clinic floor. Gardner is also not afraid to investigate people's fears and mistrust of doctors, blurring the line between where it's irrational and warranted. Anna's insistence, however overbearing, that Reggie see a Black doctor and advocate for herself if something feels off isn't without merit in a world where medical racism is rampant. In another scene, Clyde expresses skepticism at another person's sudden recovery. He's overstepping, perhaps, but the audience can't help but worry, too."", ""It's at this point that"", ""I'm Revolting"", 'steers out of dark comedy territory and just gets dark.

In a pandemic-riddled world, a show ominously titled "", 'You Will Get Sick', "" wouldn't be too appealing as a straightforward drama. So Diaz instead opts for the metaphorical and slightly absurd: In this show's world, birds lurk in the skies, waiting to snatch up anyone who gets too sick.

I did too.""', ""The play's second half muddies this journey with the introduction of a new theme: #1's desire leave his city and return to his clear-skied, spacious Midwestern hometown. The theme ties #1 closer to Callan, whose main goal is to play Dorothy in a community theatre production of "", 'The Wizard of Oz', ', plus the hay makes a bit more sense.

He incorporates parts of Euripedes's "", 'Iphigenia in Aulis', ', where Agamemnon is told by the gods that if he wants to win the Trojan War, he must offer up his daughter Iphigenia as a sacrifice. (Icke's adaptation doesn't mention Troy, only referring to the conflict by the generalized term, ""the war,"" seemingly to give his adaptation a more timeless feel.)', ""By making Iphegenia's death a large part of the production, Icke smartly emphasizes that her murder is the instigating event that breaks up Agamemnon's family and begins a destructive cycle of revenge and death. Elayna Faith Randolph and Alexis Rae Forlenza share the role of Iphigenia, who is depicted in the show as a child, which makes her death that much more chilling. Randolph, the night I saw the show, twitched her body in a way as she was dying that made me queasy."", ""But Iphigenia's death also highlights the cracks in the production. There is an explosive scene with Agamemnon and Klytemnestra arguing about sacrificing Iphigenia. There, Hille is at her most powerful. She is tall and formidable against Angus Wright's Agamemnon (Wright is a regal presence, but his take on Agamemnon is so gentle and full of ennui that it makes his abhorrent actions unbelievable)."", '""This is about us. This is about a person who came from us, who would never have lived if we hadn't loved each other. What you are destroying is us,"" Hille laments, imbuing Klytemnestra with pathos and intelligence. But it also means that, because of the modern setting and Hille's performance, one can't help but wonder why this Klytemnestra doesn't just take Iphigenia and run away?', ""That's the rub with putting Greek tragedies into a contemporary setting, as Icke does here. The nondescript set, by Hildegard Bechtler, is spare aside from a long white table and picnic benches. Bechtler also dresses the characters in somber tones, aside from Iphigenia, smartly wearing bright yellow. She's the sun, and when she dies, there's only darkness."", 'But in this modern setting, located in an unnamed country, the way the characters act makes no sense. In Greek myth, the gods are the instigating factor — they are just as impetuous and flawed as humans, and humanity is powerless under their command. This ', 'Oresteia', ' has stripped out most of the references to the gods and their fickle ways. So why does Agamemnon kill his daughter, and why is their son Orestes (Luke Treadaway) compelled to kill his mother in revenge?', ""Most of the thematic strands that Icke added into this production are so underexplored that they end up muddying the play and undercutting its power and any catharsis. Though what the production lacks in coherence, it does make up for partly in effects — there's a sound cue by Tom Gibbons, played during Klytemnestra's death, that was bone-chilling and made me jump."", 'The original ', 'Oresteia', "" was notable for its faith in the rule of law; its ending gesture favoring mercy instead of retribution was a revolutionary sentiment for the time. At that point, Icke also tries to tack on a theme about the corruption of the court system, and how crimes against women are always minimized. But the attempt at relevance is unsuccessful, because it requires a more unlikeable, and less remorseful, Orestes. Despite him being onstage for a majority of the play's running time, Treadaway does not have much to do as Orestes besides being tortured and confused. It's a one-note approach to a character that needs more complexity to be compelling."", 'Ultimately, what Icke tries to place on a trilogy of plays written over 1,000 years ago feels like putting on a jacket that's too big. Aeschylus's text doesn't fill those gaps. At the end, Orestes repeatedly asks the audience, and himself, ""What do I do?""

'Kinky Boots' review — hit musical returns with its heart and glittery heels intact,"It's not everyday a shoe gets an entrance applause. But at a recent performance of "", 'Kinky Boots', 'off Broadway, that's just what happened when the eponymous kinky boot was unveiled. Here she is, folks: bright red, sparkling, not a seam out of place, with a stiletto heel as high as the heavens, and ""two and a half feet of irresistible, tubular sex."" With her unveiling, and the entrance of the drag queen wearing her, the message is clear: ', 'Kinky Boots', ' has officially sashayed back to New York.', 'In 2013, ', 'Kinky Boots', "" the musical premiered on Broadway, with a book by Harvey Fierstein and Tony-winning original pop-rock songs by Cyndi Lauper. The show won the Tony Award for Best Musical and ran on Broadway until 2019. Now, the runway she's walking on is smaller than it was on Broadway. The band may have fewer instruments. But "", 'Kinky Boots', ' still has its big, glittery heart intact.And amid recent anti-LGBTQ legislation, the musical and its message of acceptance are more powerful and necessary.', 'The', 'Kinky Boots', ""musical is based on the 2005 British indie film of the same name (which starred a not-yet-famous Joel Edgerton and Chiwetel Ejiofor). It's based on a true story of a struggling British shoe factory owner named Charlie who, realizing that the demand is dying down for British-made loafers, pivots to making shoes for another type of man: drag queens, with the help of an opinionated queen named Lola."", 'The smaller ', 'Stage 42', "" is actually an asset. You're close enough to the stage to Lola (an incandescent Callum Francis) and her fellow drag queens (called the Angels), to admire their contouring and to see the fine craftsmanship on their boots — my eye was particularly drawn to a black and green pair of lace-up boots, and what used to appear generic green from a Broadway house is actually a patterned brocade with a sparkly white heel. Gregg Barnes's costumes are eye-popping enough for the runway at RuPaul's Drag Race."", 'Fierstein has made some changes to the show's book for this new version, and to reflect changing terminology. He cut every mention of ""transvestites"" from the script. It's a smart cut, as it means Lola is never explaining drag culture to the audience. The show also cut young Charlie and young Lola, so we never see the young Lola being slapped by her father for wearing heels, a more uneven narrative choice.', ""Charlie (a dashing Christian Douglas) and his life story introduces the musical, so it's now less about the parallel stories of Charlie and Lola, and more a story about a straight white man learning how to open his mind.Unfortunately, Charlie has always been the less interesting character — after all, the show is called "", 'Kinky Boots', ', not ', 'Practical Loafers', "". But as Charlie, Douglas is a clean-cut and upright figure who you can't imagine going to a drag show — this creates a clearer contrast between him and the rambunctious Lola. His tenor voice is also pleasing and powerful, though his Northampton accent is spotty at times."", 'Callum Francis has played Lola in the West End and on Broadway, so there's an effortlessness and youthfulness to his portrayal. His Lola is multidimensional: a bombastic show queen in the song ""The Land of Lola,"" slyly funny during the book scenes, and sensitive and soulful in the song, ""I'm Not My Father's Son."" Francis is a joy to watch. And the way he disdainfully says ""BUURRRgundy!"" should be a sound on TikTok.', 'Some aspects of this ', 'Kinky Boots', 'are less spectacular than they were on Broadway. The choreography by director Jerry Mitchell is unimaginative and lacks oomph, especially for the Angels, defaulting to mostly arm movements and an occasional high kick. How do you choreograph for drag queens with no hairography and only one death drop? RuPaul would tell you to sashay away.', 'Despite these nit-picks, now is the perfect time to see ', 'Kinky Boots', '. The musical is no longer a simple feel-good tale; it's an important entreaty for equality. There's still a whiff of fantasy about the whole thing, such as how Lola easily turns the factory's homophobe Don into a stiletto-heel-wearing ally of the LGBTQ community. But when Don says, ""You lookin' for me to say men in frocks is all right?"" and Lola responds, ""I'm not looking for you to say anything,"" the exchange packs a powerful punch now.', 'With today's news headlines of drag queens being terrorized by the Proud Boys, and the Don't Say Gay bill in Florida, we need the fantasy that Lola and her Angels provide. Or maybe it's not a fantasy. It's a promise of what's possible, if all of us, ""ladies, gentlemen, they, them and those who have yet to make up their minds,"" put on our heels and walk confidently together.', 'Kinky Boots', 'is running at Stage 42.

Beyond some too-pronounced performances, the key character of the author's father is a bit too vague and generic for his — and the play's — own good."", ""Distinctive high-def details are essential in a work in which Ogawa bluntly declares they hated their father — so much that they didn't lift a finger to honor him when he died 15 years ago. No memorial. No viewing. Nothing. A funeral director in the play is stunned at the failure to pay tribute to one's father."", ""Confronting that monumental failure is what this show is all about, and at times it feels like a public confessional and therapy session. Unfolding in a series of vignettes over 70 minutes, the play is like a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces don't all neatly interlock."", 'Ogawa, who plays their dad and younger son, has no shortage of theatrical tricks. Break the fourth wall? Constantly. Interact with the audience? Over and over. We're asked for a show of hands: ""Who here loves their father?"" ""Who here hates their father?"" We're given a sheet of paper and a pencil and instructions. Volunteers are recruited to come up on stage.', 'Ogawa is played by four actors — Ashil Lee, Kaili Y.

His presence is a bit of a head-scratcher, but shows Ogawa's role as a parent."", 'Ogawa recalls having only two conversations with their father, an executive who was better at business and bill-paying than communicating and showing love. That characterization feels very familiar. One talk involved college tuition; the other was about the failure of his marriage.', ""After their dad's death, Ogawa marveled and recoiled at what he left behind.

Dou E is framed but maintains her innocence to the last moment, declaring that it will snow in June ahead of a three-year-drought if she's innocent. All this comes to fruition, but things are quickly set right in the fourth and final act.', 'Snow in Midsummer', 'is only two acts as opposed to', 'The Injustice', ""'s four, and yet it plods. Dou Yi's (as she's renamed here) execution happens mid-Act 1, and the revelation of what really happened on the day she was framed (I won't reveal exactly how Cowhig updated it so as not to spoil the whole show) comes in the last 20 minutes, which are thrilling but feel overdue."", ""Beforehand, in this adaptation, a wealthy businesswoman, Tianyun Lin, moves to New Harmony with her daughter Fei-Fei, who is visited by Dou Yi's ghost. Tianyun spends most of the first act figuring out who Dou Yi is, and though she's tasked at the top of the second act with getting justice for Dou Yi, Tianyun is promptly sidelined for most of it as the person actually responsible for Dou Yi's death takes over. (Teresa Avia Lim, as Tianyun, does well with an uneven part.) Fei-Fei also disappears, and while that's a deliberate plot point, it's quickly dismissed.

"'soft' review — in moving new play, Black boys struggle to bloom","One of the most well-known songs in the 1967 tribal love-rock musical ', 'Hair', ' is a ballad called ""Easy to Be Hard"" whose lyrics are, ""How can people be so heartless? / How can people be so cruel? / Easy to be hard / Easy to be cold."" That song, sung by a woman to a man, points to how when it comes to masculinity, being hard and unfeeling is the default. And as dramatized by Donja R. Love's moving new play ', 'soft', ', the pressure to be hypermasculine is even more pronounced among Black boys, where hardness is an armor against a hostile world.', 'soft', ', currently running off Broadway at ', 'MCC Theater', ', takes place at a juvenile boarding school where underage Black teens with a criminal record are sent. A majority of the action is in an English class overseen by Mr. Isaiah (Biko Eisen-Martin), a newer teacher who genuinely cares about his students and their wellbeing. He encourages them to write essays about ', 'Othello', ' and express themselves in ways that are natural to them, such as through poetry or rap verse. This is despite the school's head Mr. Cartwright (Leon Addison Brown) telling Isaiah to care less, because, he says, ""the weight of what those boys need will crush you."" Indeed, Eisen-Martin depicts Isaiah walking around with slumped shoulders, as if pressed down by that weight of his empathy.', ""Then when one student, Kevin (an instantly memorable Shakur Tolliver) kills himself, Isaiah can't help himself from caring more about his students, even if they try to push him away. Here, director Whitney White makes the most out of the small black box at MCC. "", 'soft', "" is directed avenue style, with audiences on either side of the classroom. When the boys begin to fight with each other, the action is visceral, taking place just inches away from the audience. And when Isaiah tries to reach out to his students, such as to put a caring hand on them, they flinch and back away as if they've been burnt."", ""These boys are not even men, but they've been forced, by their tragic circumstances and by a society that already treats them like criminals, to harden. The stage, designed by Adam Rigg, is also surrounded by flowers of every color, as if to remind the audience that these boys are still just seedlings that need tending to. They need light and love."", 'The cast of ', 'soft', ' is uniformly excellent. They have an easy chemistry with each other and are individually compelling. Love is adept at writing for their different voices, such as Dharon Jones as Antoine, who keeps to himself and is always doodling in his notebook, or Essence Lotus as Dee, who is gay and the peacemaker in the group. Each of these actors are able to fill in their characters, painting a full portrait of each boy through mannerisms and the different ways that they spit verse.', 'The cast makes ', 'soft', ' a compelling new show, but at the same time, the play feels incomplete. For instance, Kevin's suicide drives the play, but not enough time was spent with him or seeing him interact with his classmates for his death to emotionally land. Instead, Love overrelies on dialogue to fill in those blanks, such as Isaiah saying that Kevin spoke to him before his death (though the scene is never shown), and Antoine saying he had a close relationship with Kevin, but the audience never witnesses that relationship. It risks turning this crucial character into a concept and a plot device instead of a full human being whose life was cut tragically short. Cartwright tells Isaiah, ""lives are being saved because of you,"" but the audience never sees it. There's too much telling rather than showing.', ""It's tough to write a play about people trapped in a hopeless circumstance, especially because in real life, many Black boys in underfunded schools end up becoming another statistic in the school-to-prison pipeline. And public schools are so underfunded that teachers are already fighting a losing battle; the students can physically see from the torn textbooks that the institution that they are in doesn't care about them, so why should they pay attention in class?"", 'In one scene, the show's highlight, Dee tells Isaiah, ""My life ain't tragic. It's real good. I'm real good. Fab, actually. And I'm becoming the most fab version of myself every day. I smile more than I cry."" Love is a poetic writer in the way he uses language, and it's a valiant effort to define Dee, and the other boys, through the lens of hope rather than tragedy.', 'But ultimately, ', 'soft', "" betrays itself by overly focusing on the dark instead of the light. There are no real moments of compassion and caring until the last few minutes of the play, but by that point, that hardness had formed a crust, and it's too late for that bit of humanity and light to peek through.

Though he's devoted to helping his sister overcome her grief, he's dealing with sorrow of his own, and it's touching to see him gradually open up to the aforementioned family friend, Justice (a motherly Deirdre O'Connell). Dagger also has a spot-on sibling dynamic with Jamie Brewer as Ginny, as they jump from tender moments to fights on a dime."", ""They share a subtle resentment at still living together in Corsicana, an arrangment necessitated by Ginny's Down syndrome. Similarly to Brewer's last Off-Broadway role, though (the title role of"", 'Amy and the Orphans', '), Ginny is far from helpless: she articulates her dreams and desires with confidence. When she says she'll make it out to L.A. and live with Zac Efron, you unequivocally root for her. At the same time, when she declares things like, ""people need to know that I'm a good person,"" you're sympathetic that she, too, knows things aren't easy for her.', 'In the present, it's especially difficult for her to connect with the artist Lot, a man with a master's degree who claims to have proved the existence of God with experimental math, but threw it away and turned to art because ""it's a better delivery system"" for, supposedly, the divine. He doesn't know what to make of Ginny's frankness, especially when she says things that remind him of bad memories. Similarly, she doesn't know what to make of him. It's easy for the rough character to be unreachable by the audience, but Harold Surratt gives him softness. When he disappears for most of Act 2, he's missed.', ""Finally, O'Connell holds the group together as the human embodiment of a warm hug. Fresh off a Tony win for"", 'Dana H.', ""on Broadway, she's back thriving in her Off-Broadway niche. She shines especially in Act 2 as she finally expresses her own desires after stepping back to support Christopher, Ginny, and Lot for most of the play, and in one particularly sweet scene, stumbles through a flirtation with Lot."", 'She also gets a clever monologue in which she describes a piece of writing she's working on, about, in part, ""the belief that when a part of the self is given away, is surrendered to the needs of a particular time, in a particular place, then community forms.""

We begin with the moms in a quaint suburban home — throw pillows embroidered with ""Home Sweet Home,"" photos of kids, a fireplace — at a meeting to decide who should introduce the newly elected president at an upcoming school visit.', 'Here, Del Rosso plays to the expected audience's (urban liberals) most stereotypical view of Trump voters, peppering the women's conversation with fear-mongering talk of ""illegal aliens"" and aborted children, and derisive doubt toward a local teenager who claims she was raped. We're meant to dislike them — especially PJ, who shows up proudly sporting a Confederate flag sweatshirt.', 'PJ, though, introduces a class war, as even her fellow Republicans in the room are put off by her clothing choices and brash way of speaking.

'Hamlet' review — classic play holds a mirror up to today,"The expansive new production of ', 'Hamlet', ' at ', 'Park Avenue Armory', ' opens with screens. Horatio, Bernardo, and Francisco see the ghost of the recently dead King Hamlet not in person, but through a feed of security cameras, the images warping as the king flashes in and out. This gigantic screen — and the others on either side of the stage and throughout the house — brings home that this ', 'Hamlet', ' is about surveillance. The characters are always being watched, by the cameras, by each other. And when you are always expected to put on a performance, what happens when the lines between pretend and the truth blurs? Therein lies madness.', ""Robert Icke's 3.5-hour contemporary production of "", 'Hamlet', ' played to critical acclaim in the West End (with ', 'Fleabag', ""'s hot priest Andrew Scott as the Danish prince). It has transferred to New York City with a mixture of old and new cast members. Crucially, its Hamlet is new and painfully young: 27-year-old Alex Lawther (of "", 'The Imitation Game', ').', 'Lawther plays ', 'Hamlet', "" not as a world-wise adult overcome by vengeance, but as a boyish man who is feeling too much at once: grief, disappointment, betrayal, anger, loneliness. And he has no outlet for any of those feelings. Lawther's depiction of Hamlet is similar to Marcel Spears in "", 'Fat Ham', ', another superlative contemporary adaptation of ', 'Hamlet', ' currently running at the Public Theater.', 'That surfeit of feeling means that when Hamlet comes home to Denmark to find that his mother Gertrude has quickly married his uncle Claudius after King Hamlet's death, Gertrude saying, ""All that lives must die. Passing through nature to eternity,"" is not a throwaway line. Hamlet is obviously overcome with grief — he wears black and doesn't participate in the wedding festivities — but no one actually sits down with him and helps him process his pain. Instead, they all talk about him and spy on him, treating Hamlet as a problem to be solved rather than a person in need of guidance.', 'Thus Icke's production brings home the true tragedy of the play: It's not the failed revenge plot; it's the lack of communication. It's the notion that watching someone means we know them. The only time Hamlet freely speaks is when he directly addresses the audience. Lawther delivers Hamlet's lines slowly to the audience, in a melancholy, as if he's thinking of them in the moment. But when the moment of revelation hits him, such as in the line, ""The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king!"", it inspires the audience to applaud.', 'At the same time, the play doesn't ask us to completely sympathize with Hamlet. In the ""get thee to a nunnery"" scene with Ophelia (a luminous Kirsty Rider), he doesn't just shout it. Hamlet physically assaults her — Rider's mic was off, but I could clearly hear her shout, ""Stop!"" It's a distressing moment that might have been needlessly provocative if not for the clarity behind Icke's intent: Hamlet's grief infects everything around him. When Hamlet brandishes a gun in the latter half of the play, it brings to mind the angry young men in countless news headlines with no outlet for their feelings aside from violence. ""I must be cruel, only to be kind,"" isn't just a statement here. It's a threat.', '', 'Just as Hamlet is not a clear hero, there are no clear villains. Jennifer Ehle's Gertrude and Angus Wright's Claudius are a couple very much in love — in the play's early scenes, they can hardly keep their hands off each other. This makes their hasty marriage understandable: Claudius is portrayed as a gentler figure, while Gertrude contains equal parts maternal tenderness and strength. When Claudius says, ""This is the poison of deep grief"" in reference to Hamlet's behavior, he isn't deflecting; he has a point. You get the sense that if these characters just talked to each other, a lot of pain and death could be avoided.', 'The modern-day set for this ', 'Hamlet', ' is expansive, with set and costumes by Hildegard Bechtler (though the characters look less like modern royals and more like rich Upper West Siders). The set is large but mostly spare, aside from large glass windows and a pair of Scandinavian-style couches and those giant screens. The vastness of the stage underscores the distance between the characters, and they are many times separated by a glass wall. The metaphor is obvious but effective.', 'The production also uses the music of Bob Dylan throughout. Hamlet was supposed to play in New York in 2020 at the same time as another Dylan-inspired show from the U.K.: the jukebox musical ', 'Girl From the North Country', '. In Hamlet, there's an obvious use of Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"" to soundtrack some war footage, but otherwise, Dylan's ballads ground the production.

Lines like ""By his face, you know his heart"" elicit laughs, since Richard repeatedly cajoles other characters only to deliver us an aside about his plans to murder every threat to his ascent to the British throne.', ""But when Richard steps out into the audience and explains away his wrongdoings, we listen, enraptured, and applaud on cue.

All three mine fantastic comedy (and sharp insights) from unexpected subjects, but Leiby's now stands apart as perhaps the most timely political comedy special on stage right now. Had I seen "", 'Oh God', ' the day I was originally scheduled to — May 2 — I would have left the theatre, checked my phone, and seen the news of the leaked Supreme Court brief on the potential repeal of Roe v.

""This"" being her feelings and her fear toward reproductive rights being jeopardized, as many others in my audience — mostly young women and femme-presenting people like myself — likely were.', 'Of course, that means Leiby, with her bitterly funny bits about periods and motherhood and the daily struggles of being a woman, is mostly preaching to the choir in ', 'Oh God', "". But although I'd wager a majority young, female audience is par for the course here, that's otherwise rare. It became immediately clear to me that "", 'Oh God', "" is much more than a comedy show; it's a show of solidarity."", 'I, for one, felt incredibly seen by Leiby in the most oddly specific ways, as a fellow bespectacled only child with a history of back surgery and bad geography skills whose inability to keep even a cactus alive doesn't bode well for child-rearing. Leiby also talked during her entire abortion (another thing I'd probably do), having been only partially sedated. But what really stood out about that anecdote, besides it being one of her funniest, is that it's more about Leiby as a chatty person than Leiby as a person who had an abortion. Substitute ""abortion"" for wisdom tooth removal or eye surgery, and it would have the same hilarious effect.', ""That's the vibe of"", 'Oh God', ""as a whole: Despite the title, it's not really a show"", 'about abortion', '. It's about abortion in the sense that Leiby had one, and she mentions what the options and process are like, doing a better job than a lot of actual sex education. But most of the show is filled with stories about mundane and widely relatable things relating to sex and womanhood: the awkward sex talk she had with her mom over Caesar salads, how women still can't talk about periods openly with men, and the overly chipper nature of birth control commercials — they show ""musicals breaking out in a grocery store"" when according to Leiby, they should really show a woman having a nightmare about being stuck with a crusty man and his child.', ""In other words, by not hyper-focusing on her abortion for the entire 70 minutes, she normalizes it, and shows herself as a complete and complex woman separate from motherhood. Leiby stresses that doesn't define or change her, and that abortion is something we can and should talk about in everyday conversation, not just when it's in crisis."", ""Now doesn't feel like the time to be laughing about anything remotely related to abortion — but at "", 'Oh God', ', it was a way to cope.

'Wish You Were Here' review — a compassionate look at Iranian culture,"In Sanaz Toosi's "", 'Wish You Were Here', ', five Iranian women grow together and apart from each over the course of 13 years. Their conflicts transcend the simple mundanites that comprise modern friendships. Though those issues (petty rivalries and jealousy) also appear, they play second fiddle to the compromises and personality changes that each woman is forced to undergo in the face of violent revolution.', ""The year is 1978, and five women have joined to celebrate Salme's (Roxanna Hope Radja) wedding. Though they are all boldly vulgar and silly ― and given to making jokes about their vaginas ― it is clear that none of them have ever had sex. Shideh (Artemis Pebdani) in particular enjoys taking digs at her companions over their supposed ignorance, even as she is the biggest prude of all. Zari (Nikki Massoud), is her polar opposite ― the kid sister playing at adulthood, whose best efforts inadvertently reveal her precious naviete, while Salma helps to maintain peace with self-assured kindness and appreciation for everyone around her."", 'Though most of the group are Muslim, at this point it was still safe for Iranian Jews to live in the country. Case in point: Rana (Nazanin Nour), who is Jewish, along with her best friend Nazanin (Marjan Neshat), the clear leader of this smart, poised, ready-to-conquer-the-world pack. Unfortunately, in the next scene, Rana has disappeared, and though it is clear they all miss her to certain degrees, only Salme bothers to look for her.', ""Director Gaye Taylor Upchurch elegantly indicates this loss of innocence with the group of women coming together to lift Salme's dress off her from above. Suddenly, the play has moved forward into the Iranian Revolution ― during which shows of religious piety became the rule of land, complete with women being barred from attending university. Uncowed, Shideh leaves to study in the United States, while Salme becomes more religious than ever. Happily, her religious devotion does not distract her from her compassion and love for her friends."", 'Sadly, in another shift forward in time, it emerges that Salme has died, leaving Nazanin and Zari, who do not care for each other, as the last of the group.', ""Zari is married now and following a custom to forgo bathing more than a few times a week. Nazanin is clearly disgusted, though forced to compromise with her new reality when Zari saves her from embarrassment. In time, Nazanin breaks her own vow not to marry and accepts Zari as her new best friend, though even this taming of her spirit proves small comfort when she faces additional loss. The play concludes with a visit from ghosts of Nazanin's past and the realization that she has lost everything she thought she wanted."", ""Much like Toosi's "", 'English', ', which premiered earlier this year at ', 'Atlantic Theater Company', ', ', 'Wish You Were Here', "" is another gorgeous and humanizing look at Iranian culture with a deep regard for what its citizens have been asked to sacrifice. Such compromise seems unthinkable to Americans, even as we are in the middle of a violent political upheaval of our own. In reflecting on each character's evolution, one realizes how easy it is for an unthinkable reality to become normalized ― especially when one loses access to their dreams and loved ones."", ""The production is simple and perfect, from Arnulfo Maldonado's economic set to Sarah Laux's authentic costumes and Upchurch's deft hand at arranging the bodies in beautiful tableaux. However, the cast's acting was more understated than necessary. At times I wished to hear greater characterization in the vocal performances, particularly in the opening scene, if only to set a high point for when these women felt truly free."", 'Despite my personal feelings, many of my theatre colleagues and people from Iran who have seen the play have said they found the acting entirely true to life and perfect.

There is Mikayla (Amandla Jahava, a total spitfire) whose infraction is wearing too short a skirt; Dasani (Claudia Logan), who simply wants to serve her time in peace; the mad-dog Dayrin (Toney Goins), who continues to bare his fangs even after he's been trounced; wannabe loverboy Tommy (Malik Childs); peaceful-until-he's-set-off tough guy Adbul (Mister Fitzgerald); and Erika (MaYaa Boateng), an overachiever who the students worship as the girl who will make it out of the hood."", 'With the exception of Erika, they all know the drill because they are repeat offenders with no hope of redemption — even though an intercom announcement frequently reminds them that detention is meant to help them become ""a better, more agreeable person."" Clearly the system is not working. Despite that, their warden/teacher, Mr. Bernie, doesn't have to show up for them to obey the orders that have been imposed upon them.', ""Harris's point is that in Black-majority K-12 education, detention often approximates prison. Having taught in NYC schools since 2004, I agree. With their barred windows and metal detectors, many public high schools look like prisons. Worse, they replicate slave culture by transforming students into compliant drones with frightening triggers."", 'During my final teaching assignment at a charter school in Bedford-Stuyvesant, that trigger was the word ""bowl,"" which compelled children to hold their wrists in front of them as if they were shackled together and to blow air into their cheeks as if they were goldfish. When I asked a colleague what this meant, I was told that ""we put a bowl in their mouths and hands so that they can't speak or do anything wrong."" But children who cannot speak are unable to defend themselves. And so it is in ', 'Exception to the Rule', '.', 'The trigger that keeps these students in check is a warning about consequences with ""zero tolerance"" for breaking the rules. ""If you don't know what that means,"" an intercom announcement warns, ""then we will give you a detention."" This lack of logic becomes more absurd, though no less realistic as the play continues.', 'The only person to question this system is Erika. Boateng's casting as the darkest skinned person in the production is striking because Erika is a perfect student who has learned to play ""white."" This comes to a head after she lashes out at everyone around her for their failure to understand the system.', 'Erika has made many sacrifices to escape the fate of her community. But in swallowing that poison pill, she has become as detestable as the people who will one day discriminate against her ― even as they hold her up as ""one of the good ones.""', ""Sarita Fellows's costume design is straight out of any high school in Brownsville. Kamil James and Reid Thompson's co-design of the set feels like the soul-sucking classroom of an actual high school.

The play, which is playing at MCC Theater, follows Judy (Sas Goldberg) and Jeff (Max Jenkins), two extreme fans of Idina Menzel waiting at the If/Then stage door for her autograph.', 'That premise expands into a look at what actors waiting for their big break do to stay afloat financially and artistically. The play provides an unflattering, if not accurate, anthropological dive into the assumptions about how theatre prioritizes looks and heterosexuality. In this instance, the show is devoted to white gaze and its lust for appealing to straight white men. Although Black and other people of color are left out of the discussion, it is understood that the harm caused by catering to these beliefs is as harmful to them as it is to other white people.', ""Judy and Jeff function as the other white people in this capacity. Judy resists, resents, and is unable to operate as a sexy leading lady ― despite her Broadway-ready voice ― while Jeff, her best friend, is a one-hundred-footer gay, i.e. you can tell that he's not straight from one hundred feet away. Though both rail against the unfairness of it all, they remain devoted to the idea of baring their souls through song and fanning the flames of leading lady fandom."", 'Their particular devotion to Idina Menzel comes from their belief that she is a normal everyday type who got where she is because of her hard work and incredible talent as opposed to the freak, sui generis allure of someone like Carol Channing. In this way, Menzel fuels their hope that one day, they too will make it. In the meantime, Judy keeps herself afloat as a real estate agent, while Jeff runs a popular fitness class and workshops where women can learn how to be better caricatures of women. He also has a drag show devoted to Barbra Streisand.', 'However, after Judy meets Mark (Evan Todd) at an audition and begins dating him, things start to change. Mark is the prototypical straight-presenting white man to whom musical theatre caters, despite Jeff insisting that the field was created by gay men who wrote their socially unacceptable desire into roles for leading ladies.', ""Mark is tall, attractive enough, and interested in having sex with whomever he wants without dealing with the consequences of being labeled.

'Golden Shield' review — compelling yet busy play gets lost in translation,"In Act II of ', 'Golden Shield', ', the ambitious new drama by Anchuli Felicia King, the narrator takes us through the English proverb ""too many cooks in the kitchen."" What that proverb means, says the narrator (played with energetic charm by Fang Du), is ""misguided benevolence. Too many people trying to help at once."" It's a popular adage, and it can also be used to describe King's play: compelling but overstuffed with ideas.', 'Golden Shield', ' is named after the firewall in China that enables the country to censor the internet, blocking its citizens from accessing sites such as Google and YouTube and enabling the government to crack down on dissident networks, which has led to human rights abuses. The play was also inspired by the real-life phenomenon of Chinese citizens suing American tech companies for their part in helping construct the Golden Shield (in real life, a lawsuit against Cisco was dismissed in American court). The play follows Julie (Cindy Cheung), a Chinese American lawyer, representing eight Chinese dissidents in suing ONYS Systems. But Julie does not speak Mandarin, so she hires her sister Eva (Ruibo Qian) to be her translator.', 'You would think ', 'Golden Shield', ' would be a linear courtroom drama, but King structures her play atypically. It goes back and forth in time, from when the case is first being put together in 2012 to the trial in 2016. The play is staged in a sleek and stylish way by director May Adrales, where the time jumps are clearly rendered — furniture pieces smoothly slide in and out of the puzzle-box-like set by the scenic design collective dots (the walls are also an endless array of differently shaded dots, which brings to mind the zeros in binary code).', 'Golden Shield', "" touches on a number of topical issues: how morality gives way to capitalism, censorship in the internet age, how America is culpable even as it criticizes China, and the deficiencies in human communication. The play also asks whether it's even possible to truly translate from one language to another, the nuances that get lost in translation, how language can be weaponized to misdirect or obfuscate, and whether it's truly possible to communicate with another person (even if you speak the same language)."", 'That last point is particularly relevant to Julie and Eva, whose relationship is strained because they were both raised by a mother who was a ""violently unstable petty tyrant. She is the source of Eva's suicidal ideation and dysmorphia, as well as Julie's overwhelming emotional paralysis."" This piece of information is given by the narrator, on whom the play over-relies to comment upon the proceedings. The device is clever initially but becomes a cop-out as the play progresses, a way to tell the audience what is happening instead of showing them.', ""Unfortunately, Julie and Eva are much less interesting than the play's supporting characters, which includes a quietly affecting Michael C. Liu as a Chinese professor who is imprisoned and tortured for trying to find a way to bypass the Golden Shield, and Max Gordon Moore as the pompous and amoral ONYS president who places money above human rights."", ""That is because Julie and Eva's damage — trauma from abuse and an identity crisis of being Asian American in between two different cultures — is enough to power its own play. And as recent films like "", 'Everything Everywhere All At Once', ' or ', 'Turning Red', "" showcase, there's an ample well of storytelling in the fraught relationship between Asian women and their families. Unfortunately, the sisters' story is shoehorned inside of a play already filled to the brim with themes."", ""Even though the sisters are positioned as the lead characters, even on the show's posters, they are the most one-dimensional. Though Cheung and Qian valiantly try to round out their characters through body language, the script does not give them adequate motivation for why they're even taking on the case, putting them at an emotional remove from the central tension of the play. And the slip of the reason "", 'Golden Shield', ' gives seems like self-hatred at being Asian, which, to its detriment, the play does not explore.', ""The trial and its buildup are the focus here, so much so that every time the narrative goes back to Julie and Eva having the same circuitous non-conversation about their family, it stops the play cold and robs it of energy. Their conflict seems merely a plot device to inject unnecessary drama into the proceedings, as if taking a foreign nation to court isn't interesting enough."", ""It's unfortunate because "", 'Golden Shield', ' has the ingredients to be an important and prescient piece of theatre, and King is a formidable new voice to watch. After all, despite the seeming freedom of the internet, censorship and propaganda is proliferating — not just in China but in America as well. And from ethnic cleansing to hate crimes, there have been deadly consequences in both countries. ', 'Golden Shield', ' touches on these issues without adequate space to substantively comment on them.', 'At the end of ', 'Golden Shield,', ' there is a beautiful scene between Li Dao and his wife Huang Mei (Kristen Hung, who disappears into her two roles with skill).

There, you get a sense of what ', 'Golden Shield', ' could have been, if only King had narrowed the focus of her play — not to a wide, sprawling network of loud voices drowning each other out, but to a quiet story about people trying to maintain their humanity in an increasingly dehumanizing, digital world.', 'Golden Shield', 'is at New York City Center through June 12.

Writer/performer Somi Kakoma proves this to be true. Her poetic retelling of the music pioneer's life is simple without being underwritten, hopeful without being kitschy, and celebratory of Makeba's music as well as her activism, leaving the audience inspired to continue her fight for justice and equity.', 'It's 2008; Obama has just been elected, and Makeba (Kakoma) is glowing with joy and energy. We're in Castel Volturno, Italy, watching her perform a concert. She'd retired years ago, she tells us, but makes exceptions for ""very special causes"" (in this case, a benefit for the families of South African migrants) — ""or very special money."" But there's a not-so-subtle sense that this might really be her last performance, as a chorus of four ancestors appear around her, interrupting her performance to repeatedly insist, ""It's time.""', 'Indeed, Makeba died of a heart attack during that very concert in real life. But', 'Dreaming Zenzile', 'offers a much more satisfying, if no less sad, interpretation of that event. Makeba pushes back on the ancestors at first, saying she still has so much to give and fight for. But as they take her through her most formative memories, she arrives at a sense of peace and closure,recognizing the fullness of her life and how her voice will indeed outlive her.', ""An overarching subtlety makes this show work seamlessly. Lileana Blain-Cruz's light-handed direction and Marjani Forte-Saunders's simple but expressive choreography smooth out the transitions between concert snippets and memories so they're nearly unnoticeable, yet completely clear. The show's emotional shifts are just as effortless, from the joy of love to the pain of loss to the urgent anger of activism."", 'One moment, we see Makeba get mistreated by her first love; the next, we see her falling for her true love under the glow of sunlight (the gorgeous lighting design is by Yi Zhao). Shortly after celebrating the ""sweet sound of American jazz"" when she first arrives in New York, Makeba is shunned by both the U.S. and South African governments for releasing anti-apartheid music. The realm of her ancestors soon seems like her only true home left, as they remind her byonly using her given first name, Zenzile.', 'That said, Makeba's music, as sung by Kakoma, is utterly joyous throughout. Her energetic, upbeat anthems, like the opening ""Iphindlela,""will make you want to get up and dance in the aisles. And even her ballads about strife are so soulful that they still buoy the spirit, if only because we know that Makeba survived so much hardship and inspired so many. Kakoma's performance does the same; she's tender, honest, and utterly captivating to watch.', ""The chorus play multiple characters in addition to the ancestors, all very well. Phindi Wilson, as Makeba's mother among other characters, deserves special mention for her powerhouse voice that all but brings the roof of "", 'New York Theatre Workshop', "" down. She and the ancestors sing traditional, prayerful African folk songs in between Makeba's songs, and Wilson's cries alone could shake the gods from the sky."", 'Dreaming Zenzile', "" falters slightly in its second act, as the cycle between the concert and her ancestors' interruptions, her ancestors' chants, and Makeba's memories becomes somewhat redundant. Overall, though, this bio-musical is an excellent one that feels freshamid the many others on Broadway and beyond right now.

Afong Moy, the first-known woman to arrive in the U.S. from China, was presented as a novelty attraction for Americans who paid 25 cents admission. Here, she speaks from behind a gilded frame and through time, exploring her role as an object of cultural exchange while asserting her obvious humanity.', ""It's a double act of history and drama that urgently addresses the present moment, amid an alarming spike in harassment and hate crimes against Asian-Americans. (The play was initially presented at Barrington Stage Company in July 2018.) Under the direction of Ma-Yi Theater Company's artistic director Ralph B. Peña, the production at The Public Theater is an evocative and eye-opening excavation of difference and a seductive appeal for greater understanding."", 'It's 1834 and Afong Moy (Shannon Tyo) is 14-years-old, she tells the audience. She was born in Guangzhou Province, the youngest of seven, and sold to traders of Far East imports to New York, where she's now being presented as a museum exhibit. She and the square room where she sits are intended to be representative of China. Of course, both are symbolic émigrés. ""This room is unlike any room in China,"" she says. ""And I am unlike any lady to ever live.""', 'Afong is attended by a translator and sometime handler, Atung (Daniel K. Issac), whom they wrly agree is ""irrelevant"" — because he's not on display, and is figured as a cipher for information. Though Afong addresses the audience herself, in unaccented English, whether or not she actually possesses a voice remains an open question.', 'Afong's sale was only meant to last two years, but here she is at 16, and again at 29. ""You want to understand more about the world,"" she addresses onlookers with naivete at the outset, her face painted white. The years tick by, her makeup comes off, and Afong's veil seems to lift each time she performs the same routine — reciting her origins, walking on bound feet, pouring herself tea. As an adult, downgraded from museum exhibit to cheap circus wonder, she moves into recounting the exploitation of Chinese people during her lifetime in the U.S., as railroad laborers and targets for exclusion and attack.', ""Formally, Suh's play is presentational, a study of captivity and vehicle for lesser known histories. If the staging feels hemmed in and nearly claustrophobic, that would seem by design. While Atung paces in front, Afong remains trapped behind a frame, the abundance of artificial flowers and greenery around her fading and disappearing with time (set design is by Junghyun Georgia Lee and projections by Shawn Duan). Her finery serves as a sort of mask (the intricate costumes are by Linda Cho). She longs for escape, but where would it lead?"", ""Suh's play excels when Afong and Atung spar directly, moments positioned as asides to Afong's primary mode of storytelling. It's easy to wish the pair would break out of their fated repetition for more behind-the-scenes, no-bullshit looks into the muck of performing one's difference for others' benefit, and engage with each other and the world more fully. That would also seem by design."", 'Tyo does remarkable work embodying Afong over a half-century span, incrementally transforming from something like a doll, her voice high and almost grating, into a woman shouldering the impossible weight of representing East to West. Isaac likewise performs a subtly astounding transformation of character, animating a so-called irrelevant puppet into a weary and conflicted older man.', 'The Chinese Lady', "" goes beyond an indictment of the imperial gaze, peering through the space that allows someone to be considered an other and asking what it's made of.

An overflowing amount of it she did. If you walked in without Simone's complete story or with no sense of her undeniable personal struggles alongside her worldwide acclaim, you might walk out of the theatre believing she was simply an oversexed woman, abused wife, and extremely difficult diva. What ', 'Little Girl Blue', "", named after Simone's debut album, fails to do is celebrate a complex personality, a nuanced human being, and a proud Black woman who could not — and never wanted to — be put in a box."", ""The two-act musical weaves together a set of concerts spanning eight years and two continents. Shoko Kambara's set design is minimalistic and practical, but it gives the feel of an intimate concert setting. In the first act, we're introduced to Eunice Kathleen Waymon (Simone's birth name), a woman obsessed with Johann Sebastian Bach, who had dreams of playing classical music rather than over-saturated jazz tunes, attending Curtis Institute of Music and performing at Carnegie Hall."", ""Quickly into the second act, the audience is introduced to the afro-wearing, pro-Black Simone, a woman categorized by her bipolar depression, her controlling husband (never actually seen on stage), and the music that arose from the pain. Costume designer Ari Fulton intricately sets the tone and timeline through Simone's dress; however, the opening's Cinderella-like attire and subsequent understated show pieces pale in comparison to the real singer, who served as an unapologetic visual to her expressive love songs and political music.

'Suffs' review — a historical and history-making musical,"There's one moment in "", 'Suffs', "" that will make you want to get up and raise your fist. It's early on in Act One, during a 1913 protest where over 5,000 women, wearing white, marched on Washington to demand the right to vote. In real life, suffragist and lawyer Inez Milholland led the procession astride a white horse, wearing a crown and cape. "", 'Suffs', 'impressively recreates that moment, with the powerful Phillipa Soo coming out on a full-size replica of a horse as she sings ""women of the country"" as high and clear as a bell.

Taub wrote the book and the songs and stars as Alice Paul, the National Women's Party leader who helped organize that 1913 suffrage parade. The story primarily follows Alice as she encourages her fellow suffragists to do more publicly disruptive political actions, butts heads with the older generation of suffragists, and compromises the movement for equality by prioritizing white women over Black women."", ""It's a complex undertaking, with a lot of behind-the-scenes strategizing and infighting to dramatize.

Act One then dramatizes the conversations with President Woodrow Wilson, the forming of the National Women's Party, the campaign against Wilson's reelection, and the death of a suffragist. Because Taub musicalizes multiple protests, each subsequent rallying cry takes on a certain monotony. By the end of Act One, when the suffragists hold the first public protest in history at the White House, the emotional and historical impact is lost."", 'The benefit of doing a musical instead of a play is that music can be used as a shorthand, to make audiences emotionally connect to characters without needing to know their entire life story. Unfortunately, aside from Alice's catchy ""I want"" song, where she sings that she will ""be the one to finish the fight, the fight for equality,"" the other characters'songs are mostly musicalized biographies, all verses and no chorus.', ""In one scene, Soo's Inez asks Taub's Alice if they can talk about something other than suffrage. This seemed like a moment to get to know each woman on a deeper level. Instead, the characters discuss their next protests. It's a missed opportunity to show the humanity behind the women doing the work and get the audience emotionally invested in them as people, rather than as characters in a history book.

Under Leigh Silverman's expert direction, the women give virtuosic and energetic performances — in one group number, they simultaneously play the female suffragists and the men who harass them. Under less sensitive hands, these gender-bending moments could be played for laughs, but Silverman gives them the necessary menace while giving the cast room to vamp (Grace McLean, as Woodrow Wilson, is a particularly skilled scene chewer)."", ""The many Broadway powerhouses in the cast, such as Nikki M.

Yes, you're unwittingly put at the kid's table, from which you get to watch 70 minutes of enjoyable, though trite, wisecracking and wisdom-sharing about the unbreakable bond betweenlove and pain."", ""Heartbreak's an odd fixation to have at a wedding, but then again, Carlo is attending that of an ex-girlfriend, Eva (Rebecca S'Manga Frank). Having failed to RSVP, Carlo envisions her surprise appearance as the stuff of rom-coms: She hopes Eva will realize Carlo is her one true love, who will save her from a tragically generic, heterosexual marriage. (More on that in a bit.) Carlo spends only one scene advancing that mission; most of the play sees her drinking — heavily — in an equal attempt to work up courage and drown her heartbreak, while falling into conversation with various wedding guests in a"", 'Company', '-style sequence of vignettes.', 'Each guest falls somewhere different on the love spectrum: There's Eli (Will Rogers), an earnest-to-a-fault English teacher on a potential fast track to heartbreak of his own. Maria (Carolyn McCormick), the divorced mother of the bride, shares Carlo's tactic of drinking her jealousy away upon seeing a younger woman on her ex-husband's arm. The waiter Victor (Jorge Donoso) floats mostly in the background, providing and cleaning up drinks when needed, but gets a singular moment to swoon over his ""other half."" And the mysterious, alluring stranger Leigh (Han Van Sciver) matches Carlo's jabs at love wit-for-wit, but gets her the closest to forgetting about her loneliness.', ""Wiseman, the connective tissue between them all, achieves the remarkable feat of keeping the audience's focus off the gigantic red-and-orange floral arrangement above the stage (the showpiece of Maruti Evans's rustic event hall set), and not just because her curly red hairdo is nearly as big. Wiseman's wit is sharp, her vulnerability tender, and her charm ineffable, even as she's wallowing in self-pity and picking fights with a bridesmaid (her comically similarly-named frenemy Carly, played by Keren Lugo)."", 'Unfortunately, save perhaps for Leigh, all the other characters' development gets sacrificed to accommodate Carlo's huge presence and narrow view of true love. It was most disappointing to see this happen to Eva — her big day is in the title, after all! She had the potential to be explored as a bisexual woman healthily moving on from a past relationship, but instead, she's reduced to a trope of the lesbian who ""betrays"" the lesbian community by falling for a man.', 'One redeeming way to intepret these bits of', 'At the Wedding', 'is that it actually takes place through Carlo's point of view, and there is evidence for that: The guests Carlo socializes with are likely to be an unmemorable blur if she's drunk.Some of the decorations seem to conflict — one balloon that reads ""Love is sweet"" suggests a candy theme, whereas an ""Anchored in love"" banner on the hors d'oeuvres table suggests a nautical one — not that it would matter to Carlo, who sees the whole ceremony as generic and ""extremely heterosexual"" anyway. And a neon sign on the wall reads ""til death,"" with the ""do us part"" nowhere in sight, which is just about as bleak as you'd expect from Carlo's mind. If nothing else, these details are another testament to Evans's marvelous design.', 'One other thing', 'At the Wedding', ""does get right is the lack of a clean conclusion.

Even as Rachel Hauck's white-pillared set frames it handsomely, Morriseau shows us there is something corrosive about this institution. After all, only a place ruled by white supremacy would require its Black faculty members to lead a hate crime investigation if they want a resolution."", ""Following this introduction, we are introduced to Malik (Elijah Jones, suave), a brilliant student arguing against a lower grade than he expected on one of Sandra's assignments. Though his comparson between plantation conditions in the modern-day workforce and slavery during the Civil War is apt, Sandra finds it underdeveloped."", 'This sequence feels like a wink to the audience that ', 'Confederates', ' will soon dive deeper into that very comparison and reveal everything that Malik has neglected. It does so by transporting us back to the eve of the Emancipation Proclamation, when Sara (Kristolyn Lloyd, enthralling), an enslaved Black woman, is tending to her brother Abner (also Jones), who has run away from their plantation to join the Union army.', 'Sara wishes to join the fight for liberation, and her former mistress and abusive childhood ""friend"" Missy Sue (Kenzie Ross) soon enlists her. Missy Sue has returned home from a failed marriage with a bit of enlightenment about abolition, and she blackmails Sara into spying on her father, a general in the Confederate army. In addition to placing Sara directly in the line of danger, Missy Sue also makes clear that she is in lust with her ― all the while framing her displays of love as something they both want.', ""In a return to the modern era, Sandra proceeds with her investigation by lulling colleagues and students into revealing more than they realize. During one such discussion with her white teaching assistant Candace (also Ross), Sandra confronts the racial dynamics of white allies who assume that their proximity gives them authority. Candace hero-worships Sandra and feels she can freely criticize Malik's complaints on the grounds that she and Sandra are both fighting the patriarchy while negating how Sandra and Malik are Black people in the maw of white academia.This framing is uncannily similar to the arguments that white feminists made to Black women when asking them to vote for Hillary Clinton against Barack Obama."", 'Sandra shuts that down just as she rebukes her colleague Jade (Andrea Patterson, thrilling as always), who accuses Sandra of undermining her bid for tenure. Sandra believes Jade coddles their Black students, while Jade argues that hard-ass professors like Sandra, who insist that Black students work twice as hard for half as much, are as destructive as overt racists.Patterson also plays Luanne,a lighter-skinned enslaved woman who uses sexual favors to secure her position as a house slave — playing the only card she has. In that regard, she is like every other character, willing to do anything or use any argument she can to survive, even if that means pulling others down.', ""Director Stori Ayers keeps the storytelling tight and laughs in high gear.

The show feels very much like a product of that reckoning, not least of all because real-life political moments feature heavily in the script. They're as recent as Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court nomination and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's differentiation between ""African American"" and ""American"" voters at a January press conference.', 'Then again, ', 'Help', ""'s premiere date shouldn't be a shock. Just becausecall to actions to dismantle whiteness made national headlines in 2020 doesn't mean that people, especially Black people, haven't made these calls long before. This is evidenced by the original genesis of the play: Rankine's pre-pandemic conversations with white men about the privilege they hold, first made into a "", 'New York Times Magazine article', "". Most of these conversations took place in airports and on planes, replicated on stage in Mimi Lien's set. (Its stark whiteness is surely not an accident.)"", ""Many of Rankine'slines — narrated by a charismatic yet mission-driven April Matthis, representative of Black women, in direct audience address — are pulled verbatim from her article, too, right down to the play's title. Rankine astutely wrote about whiteness there, not as a skin color, but a learned mindset. Whiteness, she explains, makes people see themselves as the default, with an inalienable right to take up space and power, unquestioned, at the expense of all others.(It's the system that likely allows me, a white critic, for example, to review a show centered on a Black woman's experience without people dismissing my credibility out of hand.)"", 'Help', ' retains this thesis andexpertly expands upon it. Within 90 minutes, ""help"" transforms from a knowing, sarcastic utterance (as in ""Spare me from these people's ignorance"") to a dire call, and her timeless observations on the pervasiveness of whiteness become time-sensitive. Not just for Rankine, or Matthis, or Black women, but everyone. She explains, with statistics and stylized movement (performed by the 11-person white ensemble behind her), that alongside Black people getting killed, incarcerated, and targeted are white men committing suicide at the highest rates. It's all for the same reason, Matthis says, steely but sorrowful: ""Whiteness is worth dying for.""', 'That line is the core of', 'Help.', 'It's empathetic without being unduly soft on the ugliness of whiteness and those who perpetuate it. Lest you think that, you can look to Taibi Magar and Shamel Pitts's fluid direction and choreography, respectively, that seamlessly blend Rankine's airplane conversations (some more open to discussions of privilege than others) with one-off quotes from white political leaders with full-on reenactments of the January 6 insurrection and the police diversity workshop in which a female captain was verbally attacked for calling out ""white male privilege."" ""If white women can get reprimanded for calling out the system of white male privilege, I should be more terrified than I am of my neighbors, colleagues, and seatmates,"" Matthis notes after that scene; the staging physicalizes the links between small and large acts of whiteness Rankine writes about.', 'Every element of', 'Help', 'coheres to create something you can't look away from. (Of course, that's the mark of any great theatre.) You can change the news channel, you can avoid difficult conversations, but you can't escape being in what Matthis calls ""the hold"" while at the show. The hold of history, of accountability, and hopefully of change, which looks a lot like an airport terminal. Fasten your seatbelts.', 'Help', 'is at The Shed through April 10.

'To My Girls' review — a comedy about friendship that needs more heart,"During one scene transition of the new Off-Broadway comedy ', 'To My Girls', ', there is a mashup of Britney Spears's ""Toxic"" and Sixpence None the Richer's ""Kiss Me."" It's a combination that's tonally so opposite you wouldn't think it works, but it, to put it frankly, slaps. Unfortunately, the rest of the play does not live up to the imaginative promise of that remix.', 'To My Girls', ', currently running at ', ""Second Stage's Off-Broadway space"", ', uses a tried-and-true dramatic formula: longtime friends reuniting for one weekend, a well-designed living room, and alcohol. JC Lee, who has also written for ', 'Girls', ' and ', 'Looking', ' on HBO, does breathe new, contemporary life into the American living room play by adding a diverse cast of characters of different races, as well as a healthy dose of millennial angst.', 'To My Girls', "" takes place over one weekend in Palm Springs, as a group of 30something gay men reunite after the Covid-19 pandemic. Curtis (Jay Armstrong Johnson) is an Instagram influencer who is becoming increasingly insecure about his body as he's nearing 40. Castor (Maulik Pancholy of "", '30 Rock', "") suffers from self-esteem issues because he's not conventionally attractive (in other words, he does not have a six-pack) but overcompensates by being annoyingly opinionated. Leo (Britton Smith) is the peacemaker of the group who is also addicted to social media. Then there's the AirBnB host, Bernie (Bryan Batt of "", 'Mad Men', "", who steals the stage every time he's on it, which is not enough), a Gen X-er perturbed by all the vain young men around him."", 'As soon as the friends reunite, the shade comes fast and furious. Says Curtis to the group: ""We always have each other because we're a family and family is forever."" To which Castor remarks: ""Just like herpes.""', 'Between drinks, dancing, and lip syncing to Katy Perry and the Pussycat Dolls, the friends realize they may have outgrown each other. Friendship breakups are as painful and heartbreaking as romantic breakups, but they are so rarely dramatized. And unfortunately, ', 'To My Girls', ' spends less time establishing the bond between why these millennials are friends and more on trading clever barbs — it is true that friends are allowed to be brutally honest with each other, but there is an odd lack of care and heart shown between the men. Which means when their conflicts come to a head, the gravity of the moment is lost. Witticism and audience laughter undercut every sensitive moment of bonding.', 'It's a shame because the script does have moments of insight about 2022 living, such as the one-dimensionality of social media, being fetishized on Tinder, and the generational differences among gay men. For instance, there is one scene where Leo says to Curtis, ""I won't go along with racism dressed as fetish. It takes daily work to remind myself I am deserving of love. So when some mediocre boy in a gay bar tells me he's not into Black guys and that's 'just a preference,' I need every fiber of my being not to collapse inward in judgment."" That Curtis responds to that proclamation by hitting on his friend is a thread the play does not adequately resolve.', ""The characters that develop most in the play are Curtis and Castor. As Curtis, Johnson does admirably with a broadly written character who puts his own selfish needs ahead of his friends. Johnson's puppy-dog demeanor keeps you from being too angry at him (and explains why Castor and Leo are still friends with him)."", 'To My Girls ', ""is truly Castor's play, and Pancholy is finally able to expand past being a supporting actor who is just there to throw out witty one-liners. Pancholy manages to be annoying, funny, and sweet at the same time. And when Castor is given room to be more introspective, he excels in delivering the material. Though he's well-suited in temperament, Pancholy may be too good-looking. When Castor talks about his body insecurities, it's hard to believe since Pancholy (while he doesn't have a six-pack) isn't exactly a schlub. Having a two-pack instead of a six-pack doesn't make you hideous, especially not in the fatphobic world of online dating."", ""It is ironic that for a play with such self-proclaimed progressive characters, the Black character, Leo, played by Smith in a grounded and subtle performance, is the least developed. Leo's function is to help Curtis and Castor along and comment on their antics, which gives his role a stereotypical overtone. The character deleting Instagram from his phone should signal a moment of growth, but it's so underwritten that it feels like an afterthought."", ""But under Stephen Brackett's direction, "", 'To My Girls ', ""does move quickly, with some genuine laugh-out-loud moments.

'Harmony' review — comedy and sorrow in near-perfect harmony,"A bio-musical about a historic male singing group whose members were cobbled together from humble backgrounds, showing in retrospect how they achieved a meteoric rise to fame amid the forces — internal disputes, personal troubles, sociopolitical forces — that threatened to tear it all down.

The many moving parts of this musical aren't in as perfect harmony as the Comedian Harmonists, but they're pretty darn close."", 'A cast of fresh-faced actors play the Harmonists in their prime: There's the boyish waiter Lesh (Steven Telsey, entering on a literal high note); the sentimental Rabbi (Danny Kornfeld), the reluctant med student Erich (Eric Peters); the caddish pianist Chopin (Blake Roman); the sardonic bass Bobby (Sean Bell); and the musical wunderkind Harry (Zal Owen), who brings the group together and fights hard to keep them that way. To Sussman's credit, none of the Harmonists feel overwritten at the expense of others, though Erich's triumphant number ""Your Son Is Becoming a Singer"" makes Peters into an early standout, and he continues to be so as his character's secrets are revealed. Roman, too, charms as Chopin in Act 1, but he equally stuns when tragedy brings out his character's vulnerable side in Act 2.', 'The actors also all tackle Warren Carlyle's high-stepping staging and choreography with ease.

'Cyrano de Bergerac' review — James McAvoy leads a classic for the masses,"Cyrano de Bergerac is having a pop culture moment lately. It's been 400 years since the real Cyrano lived and more than 100 since Edmond Rostand made his life into an 1897 play, but the skilled writer who, believing himself ugly and therefore unlovable,uses his talents to help another man woo his love was just the subject of a musical film starring Peter Dinklage. Now, British director Jamie Lloyd's fresh take on "", 'Cyrano de Bergerac', ' is making its American premiereat the ', 'BAM Harvey Theater', "", three years after debuting to acclaim in London. It's different from the lavish period film in every way, and it's worth the trip to Brooklyn."", ""Lloyd's "", 'Cyrano', ""lives comfortably in anachronism. Classics purists will still find the rhyming-couplet poetry of Rostand's play intact, butMartin Crimp's freewheeling adaptation will also delight the Gen-Z crowd:19th-century verse gives way to 21st-century spoken-word poetry and rap, including plenty of red-hot roasts.Think "", 'Hamilton', "", but faster (yes, it's possible) and with no accompaniment but a single beatboxer (Vaneeka Dadhria). To that point, Lloyd has stripped "", 'Cyrano de Bergerac', ""down to its bare essentials: no props, no period sets or costumes, only a torrent of words. Lloyd's reasoning? Words are powerful, needing nothing else to make them effective when crafted well."", 'Nothing else besides a deft wordsmith, of course, and here it's the intoxicating James McAvoy in his New York stage debut. As the lovestruck yet insecure Cyrano, he delivers ferocity, vulnerability, and passion in quick succession, and you'll want — and need — to hang on every word that Crimp has given him.Ferocity comes first: He introduces himself by leaping downstage and challenging another character to a ""swordless"" swordfight (no props, remember) at a ', 'Hamlet', 'performance. But McAvoy wields a microphone like a weapon and has a sharp enough tongue to rival any blade. (He also unleashes insults at the middling ', 'Hamlet', ' actor — Adrian Der Gregorian, a great actor parodically playing the part as a ""misunderstood,"" artsy bro at a poetry slam. If you know, you know.)', 'But lest that first scene make you think Cyrano is all anger, he divulges his love for the beautiful, intelligent Roxane (Evelyn Miller) to a friend five minutes later. Suddenly, this self-assured showstopper in leather is as flustered and giddy as a schoolboy with a crush.Cyrano can be a tough protagonist to root for, with his self-destructive pride, lofty way of talking, and constant deception, but the versatile McAvoy brings unexpected humility and humor to the character.', ""And you can't help but be enamored by the balcony scene toward the end of Act 1, the show's most arresting sequence. Cyrano feeds dialogue to Christian (a sweet Eben Figueiredo) to woo Roxane, but inadvertantly ends up speaking for Christian himself under cover of darkness. With Roxane's back turned, Cyrano delivers his love confession, a seductive monologue, straight to the audience. No matter how far you're sitting from the stage, McAvoy makes the moment feel truly intimate, an admirable feat in an 897-seat theatre. Ultimately, the only flaw in McAvoy's casting is that it's difficult to imagine him wanting for admirers, especially since he doesn't wear the honking prosthetic nose that supposedly makes him ugly.(It's worth mentioning here that Lloyd also gives Cyrano and Christian some serious homoerotic chemistry, creating a true love triangle.)"", ""Although McAvoy's presence commands constant attention at every turn, don't overlook Miller, who gives a quietly strong performance as Roxane and makes us think twice about our endearment to Cyrano. She especially shines in Act 2 — which discards much of the humor of Act 1 and digs into tragedy — with a speech decrying both Cyrano and Christian for objectifying her beauty and overlooking her intelligence. To both Crimp's and Miller's credit, the monologue doesn't feel preachy, but righteous. Cyrano wields his anger like a battering ram, bowling over everyone in sight, but Roxane wields hers like a dagger, striking pointedly at the heartstrings."", 'Cyrano de Bergerac', 'is at the BAM Harvey Theater through May 22.

There is no flattening of nuance or emotion, as can often happen when properties are given the operatic treatment.', 'This is likely thanks in large part to Nottage ― who has adapted her own text for the new libretto ― as well as her partnership with composer Ricky Ian Gordon, director Bartlett Sher, costume designer Catherine Zuber, and choreographer Dianne McIntyre, in bringing the story to life.', 'Intimate Apparel', ' follows Esther Mills (Kearstin Piper Brown), a Black seamstress on the verge of becoming an ""old maid"" in 1905 Manhattan. Esther dreams of opening her own beauty parlor that caters to other Black women and starting a loving family, and the plot kicks into high gear when she begins a written correspondence with George Armstrong (Justin Austin), a Caribbean man working on the Panama Canal.', ""Esther is illiterate and turns to her wealthiest patron, Mrs. Van Buren (Naomi Louisa O'Connell), to decipher and respond to each loving missive.

After George proposes marriage, Esther accepts, sight unseen, despite warnings from her landlady Mrs. Dickson (Adrienne Danrich) that this peculiar arrangement will leave her dejected."", ""True to that prophecy, upon finally meeting on their wedding day, Esther learns that Armstrong is not the gallant man of his letters, just as she is not the fair maiden of hers.

Each woman within the play has a unique inner life that is impossible to fulfill without severe compromise.', ""We see this during landlady Mrs. Dickson's powerful warning to Esther, that she's forsaking love in favor of security. In her role as a woman who has seen both sides of love, Danrich pierces one's heart as Dickson when she shapes her lush voice into a near howl of anguish: Unlike Mrs. Dickson's mother, who worked her hands bloody, Mrs. Dickson has magnificent hands ― but nothing warm to hold on to."", ""Brown brings Esther's deepest yearnings to life with a warm soprano that continues to blossom, most particularly when she pleads for the love she deserves. Brown's performance is much like Zuber's magnificent costumes: contained and lovely, but even more magnificent once the top layers are removed to reveal the intricate undergirding below."", 'As George, Austin completes a full 180-degree transformation from the upright seeker of love that Esther dreams of in her letters into the lumbering, gambling ""Bajan"" boy who refuses to love her. When he sings that she'd be prettier with a little bit of lipstick, Austin beautifully inserts a level of coaxing and soothing into his voice that reveals Nottage's ultimate point: Much like Viola Davis, who won the 2004 Drama Desk Award for Best Actress for her performance in the play's premiere, Brown is beautiful with or without makeup.', 'But in this society, women who refuse to doll themselves up are considered ugly. It does not matter how hard they work or how generous they are; the world will not see women if they are unadorned and will ignore what lies below the glittering facade if they are.', ""Gordon's music reveals the tragedy of that reality perfectly.

The cozinessborders on voyeuristic: There's a plainly visible toilet at the front of the stage, a bare mattress on the floor nearby, and candles and string lights casting their bits of light around, as though we've entered this apartment as a secret ritual is about to begin. This sense of intrusion is grimly appropriate for"", 'SHHHH', ', a play that lays bare the very personal process of healing from trauma.', ""A ritual doesn't come until the end of "", 'SHHHH', ', but Clare Barron's entire play is an exorcism of sorts. A collage of vignettes — chronologically ordered, but otherwise self-contained — focus on the young TV writer Shareen (played by Barron, who also directs) in the extended aftermath of a sexual assault. The lack of a traditional, fully linear narrative is fitting for the subject matter: Trauma fragments memories, and Shareen has a messy journey with no clear end in sight. For one, she remains friends-with-benefits with her assaulter Kyle, the cookie-cutter ""nice"" bro played with just a touch of self-unaware slime by Greg Keller. (He opens the show by telling Shareen a gory story while on the toilet, implying an indifference toward boundaries.)

Though wails of grief are certainly part of it, hollering is an act of mourning that overwhelms the whole body.

Sadie, who is mute to those around her but addresses the audience with a formidable grace, tells us she can raise the dead. Determined to uncover her mom's fate, Sadie asks her maternal ancestors; they don't have the answers, but Sadie recounts their warrior-like triumphs over racist fools in wonderfully vivid monologues."", 'A wounded vet (Billy Eugene Jones) acts like something of a pastor, leading the hollerings with soulful call and response.

The third house belongs to a pair of aging sisters, one who constantly tends the hallowed ground (Lizan Mitchell) and another (Stephanie Berry) who vigorously, and often hilariously, tends only to herself.

Though time is the one thing we cannot replace, after listening to each character speak, I felt that their earned wisdom might spare me future pain.', 'That is the gist of ', 'Out of Time', '. These individual characters all wish to impart lessons as atonement for their failings. With the exception of Sam Chanse's ""Disturbance Specialist,"" they manage to avoid didacticism. Though one can even forgive this faux pas, as she has penned a scorching yet compassionate send-off for once-lauded elders who have tripped into the zeitgeist of cancellation vs. accountability.', 'In ""Disturbance Specialist,"" Natsuko Ohama plays Leonie, an unrepentant activist and educator who finds herself ""canceled"" after issuing an unfortunate tweet. She never presents context for what she said. Instead, Chanse illustrates the tragedy of a self-inflicted fall from grace. Ohama is thrilling as she waxes between defensiveness, descriptions of potential offenses, acknowledgment of harm, and finally, acceptance that there is no redemption for her.', 'Redemption also factors into the evening's two strongest entries ― Anna Ouyang Moench's ""My Documentary"" and Naomi Iizuka's ""Japanese Folk Song"" ― both of which could easily expand into evening-long works. In the former, Page Leong portrays an unnamed documentary filmmaker who connects the early death of her twin sister to a later loss in her life. As her character, Leong exudes the crisp remove of an impartial investigator, though her mask slips as she wanders toward the one thing she cannot control: love. The tragedy is that there is no way to redeem love after it is gone.', 'In ""Japanese Folk Song,"" Glenn Kubota renders Taki with the affable charm of an indulgent grandparent who manages to make griping fun. Taki has no occupation; he simply meanders through reveries. Eventually, he latches onto his loathing for the arbitrary chaos of jazz music. But in recalling his first wife's favorite song ― Thelonious Monk's ""Japanese Folk Song,"" which is based upon the Japanese folk song ""Kōjō no Tsuki"" ― he begins to hear the undergirding tune. This awakens Taki to his current reality, which was caused by a betrayal, but from which there is no escape.', 'Watching Kubota and Leong grapple with their personal hells in these beautifully crafted monologues is worth the price of admission on its own.', 'Mia Chung's ""Ball in the Air"" and Jaclyn Backhaus's ""Black Market Caviar"" are less captivating, though I admired their willingness to be weird and challenging. ""Ball"" features Mia Katigbak unleashing her unerring skill with a paddle ball. The trick, she reveals, is in her concentration. Faltering concentration becomes an analogy for what happens to her character, Ena, after she loses her composure. Though Katigbak is fully committed to the part, ""Ball in the Air"" feels too on the nose in connecting that point ― concentration vs. losing oneself ― to its conclusion.', 'Meanwhile, ""Black Market Caviar"" is framed as a video recorded by Carla as a glimpse into the future scarcity of certain goods.

Quaint and homey, if you ignore the nearby people griping about the ""erasure of white history from schools"" and Meghan Markle's admission into the British royal family.

They are, frankly, why it's hard for this Cosmo-ordering, female friendship-obsessed reviewer to quantify the star value of the show."", ""On one hand, it's not extraordinarily well-written nor is it offering any earth-shattering contributions to the theatrical landscape.

'Long Day’s Journey into Night' Off-Broadway review — welcome to lockdown's journey into night,"In a bright stroke in director Robert O'Hara's intriguing but not always persuasive take on "", ""Long Day's Journey into Night"", "" set in Covid-era 2020, Mary Tyrone spends the opening moments silently practicing yoga. Dressed in leggings and a long-sleeve hoodie, the morphine-addicted matriarch motors through poses — downward dog, cat-cow, pigeon. Welcome to Lockdown's Journey into Night."", 'Yoga actually turns out to be an apt activity for Mary in Eugene O'Neill's 1957 Tony winner. She is always posing. When she swears to her husband and sons she's off the stuff, it's all just a well-rehearsed act. Before long, she inevitably slinks upstairs for, as a son bluntly says, ""another shot in the arm.""', ""Along with the present-day setting — FedEx boxes, CNN reports, an edition of Newsday, and hand sanitizer are seen in the living room — O'Hara's handling of Mary's addiction stands apart from other revivals. He delivers a dose of raw reality: We watch Mary as she rolls back her sleeve, ties off her arm, and, just out of view, shoots up. She does this several times."", 'It's unsettling the first time. Subsequently the idea self-sabotages. To illustrate that Mary is doped up, psychedelic projections designed by Yee Eun Nam are beamed on the wall as the former convent girl slumps into narcotic submission. At best, trippy visuals are unnecessary. At worst, the imagery is gimmicky. Specters that materialize on the wall also backfire. No doubt they're inspired by family members referring to Mary as a ghost. In my notes I scribbled, ""Scooby Doo."" Presumably that's not the desired impact.', ""In the end, whether it's a traditional revival of the play set in August 1912 that runs four hours or an experimental time-leaping vision with deep cuts to the repetitive script adding up to a 110-minute running time, special effects aren't needed to make the drama click. As the Tyrones shatter illusions and trade regrets and accusations, a consistent tone and tight connection by the actors to their characters and each makes the story harrowing. The links forged in this Audible Theater production at times go slack."", ""As Mary, Elizabeth Marvel, a fearless stage actor, shows off her physical and vocal dexterity. She opts for a baby voice when Mary repeatedly talks about finding her glasses. With the character of the maid left on the cutting room floor, she's left to deliver some long passages to herself and that works well enough. Mary, as always, gets the play's final line — and it makes you shudder."", ""Like Mary, who's hooked on drugs, the Tyrone men grapple with alcohol. As James, an actor whose penny-pinching is blamed for being the root of the family's ruin, Bill Camp conjures an air of theatricality and both love and contempt for his wife and his sons. At pivotal moments, Marvel and Camp, real-life spouses, trade volume for depth. And in the heat of noisy arguments they sound like they're playing George and Martha from "", ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", ""Jason Bowen makes a credible Jamie, a so-so stage actor who owes his minor successes to his father and has a love-hate relationship with his brother.

'Kristina Wong: Sweatshop Overlord' review - an important collective processing of the pandemic,"In the beginning of the show ', 'Kristina Wong: Sweatshop Overlord', ',Wong gives the audience a trigger warning: ""The show takes place in the pandemic."" Said by almost any other artist at this point, that statement might be met with an internal groan. After all, we're still living in the pandemic and still deeply traumatized by the past 20 months, what insight can possibly be gained right now? But Wong's delightful and deeply moving one-person show at ', 'New York Theatre Workshop', ' may be just what we all need to start processing the events of the past year.', 'This is because ', 'Sweatshop Overlord', "" is not just a compendium of all that was traumatic about the past 20 months. It is more specific and compelling than that. Using her off-kilter and tongue-in-cheek humor, Wong describes how she started a virtual sewing circle with women from all around the country, to make free masks for people who needed them. And it's an indication of Wong's sense of humor that the group name, Auntie Sewing Squad, also forms the acronym ASS."", 'Yet despite the light-hearted name, there is a deep importance to what ASS were doing, using what is traditionally relegated and diminished as women's work to save the lives of strangers. What started off as a hobby to get through the early days of the pandemic became, as Wong says, a ""shadow FEMA,"" providing masks, and even hand sanitizer, to healthcare workers, Native American reservations, immigrant farmworkers, unhoused folks, ICE detainees, Black Lives Matter protesters, and the many other marginalized groups overlooked and ignored by the American government.', 'The women in (what Wong cheekily calls) her sweatshop, have sewn 350,000 masks (full disclosure: ', 'I wrote about the Auntie Sewing Squad last year', ""). But this isn't one of those feel-good stories about how regular people persevered despite the failures of American society, like those stories about strangers donating to people's medical bills on Kickstarter."", 'The genius balance that Wong is able to achieve in ', 'Sweatshop Overlord', ' is her ability to highlight the feel-good, human interest aspect of the Auntie Sewing Squad with a deep indictment of American society. What kind of country, Wong exclaims, makes a circus out of billionaires flying off into space, yet is unable to provide its healthcare workers and the most vulnerable among us with life-saving PPE? ""Is America a banana republic disguised as a democracy?"" asks Wong. The audience at New York Theatre Workshop, utterly invested in Wong's story, answered with a resounding yes at the night I attended the show.', 'That is not to say that ', 'Sweatshop Overlord', ""is a bummer (it's more like "", 'Full Frontal with Samantha Bee', 'rather than ', '60 Minutes', '). The set is cuddly and ', 'Sesame Street', ""-esque, with a Hello Kitty Sewing Machine at its center and oversized sewing supplies made of felt (Junghyun Georgia Lee designed the set). Lighting designer Amith Chandrashaker skillfully transitions between the different moods of the show. And director Chay Yew makes sure that Wong's spitfire humor lands with the audience, while allowing for moments of stillness and heart. The thrust staging, with the audiences on three sides, also makes the show feel more intimate and inviting."", ""Wong is an energetic and engaging performer, with an everywoman appeal (no small feat considering that, as Wong points out, an Asian face has been considered foreign and dangerous during this pandemic). When Wong describes how going outside at the height of the pandemic in 2020 felt like going into battle, and Wong is crawling on her forearms and knees as she's saying this, the audience understands exactly what she felt. We may not have crawled on our stomach to go to the Post Office, but putting on our masks and gloves to go outside then did feel like going into a war."", ""There has been an overwhelming sense, as society has started to reopen again, that we are all moving too fast to put the pandemic behind us. We haven't had the time to process, mourn, and take stock of who we have become. "", 'Sweatshop Overlord', 'is theater at its best and most essential. It brings the audience together in conversation, giving us space to be still, and to really look inside ourselves and at the world.', 'The past year has highlighted how America is broken on a very deep level. But if we can all emerge from this pandemic better people, who are able to care more deeply for one another, especially for the people we have not met, then perhaps we can help make it all a little less broken.', 'As Wong asks the audience the end of ', 'Sweatshop Overlord,', '""What do you hope for as we move forward?

"'The Visitor' review - a well-intentioned, yet out-of-touch musical","There has been much drama around', 'The Visitor', ',', 'the new Tom Kitt, Brian Yorkey, and Kwame Kwei-Armah musical. The show's opening last year was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then when it was scheduled to return this fall, the first two preview performances of the musical were postponed to, per the Public's statement, ""accommodate for more time for the company to address questions about race, representation, and identity."" Then one of ', 'The Visitor', ""'s stars, Tony winner Ari'el Stachel, departed the musical. Why would Stachel, who had been part of the musical's development process for six years, leave it right before opening night?"", 'There is a possible answer, and it points to the fundamental flaw in ', 'The Visitor', ' itself.', 'The Visitor,', ""based on the 2007 film of the same name, follows college professor Walter, who is white and suffering from grief at the death of his wife. Through chance, he meets Syrian refugee Tarek, who is at risk of being deported. Through Walter's attempt to keep Tarek in America, Walter learns how to connect with other human beings again."", 'When ', 'The Visitor', ' was released in 2007, it was the rare attempt to humanize Muslims in the eyes of Americans, during a time when Muslims were demonized in the media, while the American military pillaged Afghanistan and Iraq. And because it was 2007, it was common to have a white narrator be the eyes for the audience, to translate this ""foreign"" world of immigration, political asylum, and ICE custody to them.', 'In 2021, the same story with the same white narrator has turned this entreaty for humanity into a white savior narrative that, while well-intentioned, is woefully out of touch.', ""The musical opens with Walter, played by Emmy winner David Hyde Pierce, going through the motions while teaching. Walter then meets Tarek (played by Ahmad Maksoud, who was Statchel's understudy), Tarek's girlfriend Zainab, a refugee from Senegal (Alysha Deslorieux), and Tarek's mother Mouna (Jacqueline Antaramian). Each of the immigrant characters have a compelling narrative about why they came to America, what happened in their homeland, and how much they've suffered because of America's inhumane immigration system. Yet you won't find much from them in terms of character development."", ""Instead, the focus is on Walter and his interiority, how Tarek being imprisoned by ICE has opened Walter's eyes to the rot and hypocrisy of America. The people of color in the story are constrained to being side characters, nobly suffering. While Walter is given a career and character motivations, by contrast, Tarek is only given broad strokes of a characterization: He loves Zainab and plays the drums. But not much is given about what his dreams are, how he met Zainab, why he needs to play music. Walter is given a character arc while Tarek, who is facing deportation back to Syria, is constrained to nobly suffering."", 'Sure, one man learned about U.S. immigration law and was woken up by it, but another man is about to lose his home and will be sent back to a war-ravaged country. The stakes are markedly different and it is ', 'The Visitor', ""'s fatal flaw that it tries to even place them on an equal playing field."", ""This is not the fault of the actors. Pierce is sensitive and likeable as Walter, his sad eyes truly pierce your soul. It is a testament to Pierce's likability that his ignorance about the injustice of the American immigration system comes off as naive instead of, well, privileged."", ""Maksoud portrays Tarek with a surface level of depth: Tarek's scenes in ICE detention are played with resignation, lacking any emotional punch. But considering that Maksoud was the understudy, perhaps his performance will feel more lived-in with time."", 'The women of the cast are the ones who truly shine. A highlight of the show is their affecting duet ""Lady Liberty,"" with lyrics like ""You say give me your tired, your poor. Well we've got more. They knock, but you're not at the door,"" with equal parts tenuous hope and bitter cynicism. As portrayed by Antaramian and Deslorieux, with a steel spine and intelligence, these women are not simple victims. They are survivors.', 'But it is notable that none of the immigrant characters in the story are ever truly angry at the injustice of their circumstances. Instead it is Walter who is allowed to be angry, in his 11 o'clock number where he sings out in a rallying cry: ""We must find our better angels. And our country's stolen soul. And remember where we came from. And make what's broken whole.""', 'Who is the ""we"" here? Because for many immigrants, Black people, and people of color, America's better angels never existed.', 'The Visitor', ""expects white rage and white awareness to be worth applauding. But we've gone past the time when awareness and rage is a milestone. The U.S. has kept migrant children in cages, Syrian refugees drowned at sea trying to escape war: The time has passed for raising awareness. It is time to take that rage and put it into action."", 'That is not to say ', 'The Visitor', "" needs to include a call-to-action for fixing America's broken immigration system. But the musical's narrow focus just shows how ill equipped it is for meeting the current moment."", 'The Visitor', ' ends with Walter sitting in an empty apartment, his new friends having left. He has seen true suffering but can remove himself from it and be, ultimately, unburdened of it. That is privilege.

'Winnie the Pooh' review — an hour of bountiful joy accessible to all,"There are many ways that a live-action production of Disney's "", 'Winnie the Pooh', ' could have gone awry. Thankfully, the newly opened Off-Broadway musical adaptation of ', 'Pooh', "" has eschewed a theme park approach and focused instead on the story's folksy charm."", 'Anyone who grew up reading the A.A. Milne books or watching the Sherman Brothers-scored movies knows that there is not much of a plot to ', 'Pooh', '. The original stories follow a silly stuffed bear who comes to life and goes on adventures while waiting for his human friend, Christopher Robin, to return from school. Usually those exploits involve securing honey, which Pooh loves as much as a certain cartoon mouse does cheese.', 'Rather than expand that concept into an overly long extravaganza that comments on the avaricious nature of men, this Rockefeller Production-designed show respects its source material and allows the action to unfold almost exactly as it does on the page.', ""For audiences, that means a manageable 65-minute-long romp with Pooh and his anthropomorphized friends as they enjoy what makes each of the four seasons enjoyable: the blusteriness of autumn and rescuing Piglet from a runaway kite; befriending a snow-lady in a winter wonderland; ruining Rabbit's vegetable garden while practicing bouncing with Tigger and Kanga; and of course, rescuing Pooh from a honey tree. Though Christopher Robin makes a brief appearance at the top of the show and conclusion, as in "", 'Toy Story', ', here the toys are the thing.', 'Upon entering the newly renamed Hundred Acre Wood Theatre at ', 'Theatre Row', "", audiences are met with a gorgeous set which David Goldstein has designed to evoke the illustrative magic of Milne's original artwork. The overall effect is that one actually feels as if they are standing within the world of Pooh's picture books."", ""Soon, Jake Bazel saunters onstage with a life-size puppet of our leading character attached to his front. Bazel plays Pooh with a bemused grin while leaning into his clueless though amiably selfish ways. He manages this feat without reducing Pooh to a narcissistic rapscallion, though at times ― like Kristy Moon's Piglet and Roo and Kristina Dizon's Kanga ― he adds on twee affectations that appear to comment on the potentially saccharine nature of the material, rather than simply allowing the action to unfurl. Perhaps the three gifted performers were simply pushing childlike ardor harder than was necessary for the 10 a.m.performance I attended."", ""What rightsthe sentimental balance of the show is Emmanuel Elpenord's show-stealing comedy as a knowingly ho-hum Eeyore, smart-alecky Owl, and exasperated Rabbit. Elpenord's characterizations are wry without ever being arch, and winkjust enough at the adults in the audience to invite them into the jokes as well. He is joined by Chris Palmieri's artfully scatterbrained Tigger who all but bounces away with every scene he appears in."", ""Elpenord and Palmieri also show the greatest level of detailed puppetry and physical theatre; they enter and exit each scene with the same commitment to character whether they are embodying butterflies, snowflakes, or a named character. Additionally, their foot and hand work are so precise that one starts to believe that Matthew Lish's wonderfully crafted puppets have actually come to life."", ""Pooh is decidedly gentle entertainment. Much like Rockefeller'sother equally loving production,"", 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar Show,', 'this show feels as if it has been specifically designed so that audiences of all stimulation levels can comfortably attend. Indeed, at the performance I attended, there were adults with advanced autism waving their hands with glee as well as rambunctious toddlers and tykes, some of whom were undoubtedly enjoying their first live-theatre experience.', 'I am unashamed to admit that observing them revel in the beauty of this production, content in the knowledge that they were safe to do so, reduced me to tears.', 'It was only a matter of time before Disney gave ', 'Pooh', "" the same theatrical translation as its other intellectual properties; that's why I'm thrilled that the behemoth trusted this production team to do so with gentle care rather than exaggerated flash. Though there is much talk about access to theatre around racial lines, it is rare to see that same consideration given to those with sensory limitations.

'Trevor: The Musical' review — too much filler slows an 'earnest and well-acted' musical,"How do you turn a quirky 17-minute flick about a 13-year-old grappling with his sexuality and thoughts of self-harm into an old-school two-act musical?

Bullying, intolerance, and self-acceptance are so not 27 years ago. They still sting with resonance in 2021.', ""On stage, the show traces the movie plot set in 1981 in and around a junior high school. Trevor (a confident Holden William Hagelberger) has an obsession with Diana Ross (Yasmeen Sulieman) rivaled only by his burgeoning boy-crush on classmate Pinky (Sammy Dell), the hunky school jock. Trevor hasn't totally wrapped his head around his same-sex attraction. He shares his Pinky passion only with his trusty personal diary."", ""If you've ever seen "", 'Afterschool Special', ' (or ', 'Mean Girls', ', or ', 'Dear Evan Hansen', ""), it's only a matter of time before Trevor's private communications fall into the wrong hands and hurl him into a world of hurt."", ""Between its off-kilter tone, brief running time, and lack of quick-fix solutions, the movie deftly balanced the broad shifts from silly to life-and-death serious. It also trusted the audience to fill in the blanks and recall their own experiences as Trevor interacts with classmates and his parents and other clueless adults. Who hasn't felt like an alien at some point?"", 'Dan Collins (book and lyrics) and Julianne Wick Davis (music), along with director Marc Bruni (', 'Beautiful', ""), are less successful at finding an equilibrium and letting the story breathe. Overstatement and dollar store cliches nag throughout the story, which has been expanded but not deepened. Trevor's humiliation has transformed into a teen conspiracy. Flashy production numbers choreographed by Josh Prince are sharp and fun but also feel like padding."", 'Occasionally, Collins serves up a fresh zinger. Case in point: Aschool creep sneers at Ross's music, saying, ""The album is called ', 'Diana', '?"" Trevor, as only a discerning, true-blue fan could, responds, ""No. It's called ', 'diana', '.With a lowercase 'd.'"" If only the rest of the story was so clever and unexpected.', 'Original songs by Collins and Wick, the team behind the transgender-themed musical', 'Southern Comfort', ', are mostly pleasant place-holders.

'Baby' review — a 'stripped down' production struggles with exposition,"A collection of beautiful Broadway-scale voices roar across the 60-seat performance space of ', 'Theatrelab', ' in Manhattan as the musical ', 'Baby', ' announces that it is back! The only problem is the show is entirely too much for such a small venue. That theme of too much, or doing the most with the least, is an ever-present issue that Out of the Box Theatrics never resolves in the remount of its 2019 production.', 'But what does ""too much"" mean? Well, ', 'Baby', ' follows three couples ― college sweethearts on the cusp of adulting, two established 30-year-olds, and an older couple ― as they all process surprise pregnancies. Rather than focus on one couple, the show tries to be all things to its six principal characters, so that what one gets is more of an underdeveloped mini-series than a musical. This manifests as a 2-hour-and-40-minute-long beast that, regardless of how well directed and performed it is, overstays its welcome by at least 50 minutes.', ""During a pre-show announcement, the production's director and choroegrapher Ethan Paulinirevealed that his team worked with the show's original creators ― composer David Shire,lyricist Richard Maltby, Jr.,and book writer Sybil Pearson― to update the show. Indeed, Maltby, who served as the original 1983 Broadway production's director, is credited as a directing and writing consultant."", 'Their updates include transforming the college coupling of Lizzie (Liz Flemming) and Danny (Johnny Link) into a legally blind and partially deaf duo, as well as the formerly heterosexual 30-year-olds into a lesbian couple ― Pam (Danielle Summons) and Nicki (Jamila Sabares-Klemm). Additionally, rather than observe six white people kvetching about their relationships, the casting for this production includes two Black people and one Filipina actress among its principals.', 'These changes are welcome breaks with ', ""Baby's"", ' aggressively white and heternormative view, but they fail to cut through the show's original sin: relentless didacticism. For example, Pam and Nicki go through an exposition-heavy visit with an invitro fertilization specialist that tediously explains the entire process to the audience. Similarly, Danny and Lizzie over-narrate how they met and fell in love at their ""woke college"" in ascene that could have been dispatched with a few throwaway lines.', 'When the show isn't revealing information that anyone with an internet connection or reasonable life experience could divine for themselves, it is musicalizing trivial moments that could have been omitted altogether. For example, the twin solos in ""The Plaza Song""feature Arlene (Julia Murney) and Alan (Robert H. Fowler) attempting to figure out how ""it"" happened ― while cute, this song is woefully unnecessary. This says nothing of the show's seven reprises or the regressively stale repetitions of ""being a guy is hard"" that one finds in ""Fatherhood Blues"" or ""At Night She Comes Home To Me.""', 'Of course, certain sequences, such as when Lizzie and Danny contemplate ""What Could Be Better"" than being together or when Pam, Lizzie, and Arlene reveal that they want all aspects of womanhood in ""I Want It All"" are absolutely thrilling and essential to the musical's action and character development.

'Medicine' review — a thought-provoking play with too much sensory overload,"The way that one tells a story is often just as important as the tale that's being told, which is why the clash of cacophony and tedium that comprises Enda Walsh's "", 'Medicine', ' ― currently playing at ', ""St. Ann's Warehouse"", ' ― struck me as such an enervating experience.', 'Medicine', ' follows a patient named John (Domhnall Gleeson) who reenacts pre-recorded, immersive therapy sessions with the help of two actors and a skilled drummer (Seán Carpio) to remind himself why he has surrendered his autonomy to an unnamed mental health facility. This is in place of a monitored annual review presided over by a team of professionals so that ― regardless of what may occur during this session ― the predetermined conclusion is that John is unfit to return to society.', 'Audiences divine this over the course of the 90-minute show while attempting to ascertain whether what is happening is real, a hallucination, or a memory. That Walsh chooses not to specify this from the get-go could be part of the fun. Many people in the audience the night I attended found the experience titillating.', ""I felt that because so much work was put into obfuscating where the story was going ― and because I figured out what was occurring too quickly ― there was not enough left over to hold my attention. It's not that the actors were ever less than fully engaged; indeed, Gleeson's extended bouts of yelling were truly affecting. But after being walloped over the head with bursts of temper tantrums, loud noises, light effects, random acts of unreasonable violence, and extreme silence, I found myself yearning for greater nuance. Imagine someone yelling the first half of a sentence at you and then whispering the latter part with gravitas. That sounds potentially enthralling on the surface, until you experience said effect play itself out repeatedly as the conflict of extremes did here. Far from exhilarating, I came away feeling detached and dehumanized."", 'A major issue is the manner in which ', ""Medicine's"", "" puzzle is unraveled. Part of the pleasure in observing any mystery is experiencing the twist ― realizing that the playwright has led you astray from the get-go as they masterfully remove your blindfold to reveal that you are teetering over the edge of a collapsed bridge that you'd have sworn was the road to certainty. One is not offered solid footing in "", 'Medicine', ' until a full recording reveals the full dishonest truth ― that these sessions were more pageantry than an opportunity for redemption ― and we are left staring at the face of our leading man as the light of dawn washes across the stage.', 'One could say that in directing this story, Walsh wants audiences to understand how mental unwellness feels. Where he failed, for me, was in providing the nuance of an ordinary world in which John had a reason to believe that he was in control and should be released from his asylum. Instead, as rendered by Gleeson, he is nebbish and lacks assertive drive over his own story from the start.', ""A reasonable person might look at what John is subjected to and ascertain that the asylum is willfully invalidating any sense of autonomy that he might have so that he agrees to continue paying them to control him; or that Walsh is artfully presenting the way that some mental health agencies operate so as to retain authority over their charges. That's a solid perspective when one considers that abuse does exist and is often unmonitored if not ignored within the mental healthcare industry. But, rather than engage with this critique directly, Walsh focuses on light shows, actors in strange costumes, and lip-synching to audio recordings that lack context."", ""As one of the actors who has been hired to convince John that he should remain within the asylum's care, Mary #1 (Clare Barrett) exhibits a swaggering narcissism that one might expect from a person with borderline personality disorder.

It's not the most romantic setting for an adaptation of a novel known for its love story. This particular one sees Anne Elliot hoping to rekindle her love with one Frederick Wentworth, who has the trappings of a war hero and is the most eligible bachelor in town. Unfortunately, eight years before, a family friend advised her to break off her engagement with him due to his lesser social standing at the time. Oh, the irony."", ""But romance isn't the focus of this "", 'Persuasion', "". The production by Bedlam, which presented Austen's"", 'Sense and Sensibility', ""in 2017, emphasizes that there's nothing endearing about your family, in this case the Elliots and their in-laws the Musgroves, judging your every romantic prospect and social interaction. Awkwardness is the dominant feeling onstage, as no one has any privacy and nothing better to do than observe each other making faux pas while vainly hoping no one sees their own. The result is a hilarious and relatable adaptation for those of us nervously readjusting back to in-person socializing."", ""Sarah Rose Kearns's script keeps Austen's period dialogue, so the staging, under direction by Eric Tucker, achieves the comic effect. In some scenes set at the loud and decorum-challengedMusgroves' estate, an actor (often Randolph Curtis Rand, in a subtly comic performance) holds a tree branch or a painting. We assume the set budget was low and we're supposed to ignore them. And then, as the other characters' conversation gets interesting, they casually peer over their prop as though eavesdropping."", ""If they're caught listening, or if someone realizes they said something odd, there's a plethora of ways Tucker has them diffuse the situation, to varying degrees of success.

In a shrewd move for a play whose ideas get the mind humming, this revival begins and ends inside Vivie's head. Vivie hears voices —echoes, actually —in these brief bookends. ""The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want ... and if they can't find them ... they make them.""', ""The implications of this are wide-reaching, and circumstances loom large in the story. The plot turns on bombshell revelations, and even at an hour and 40 minutes, it takes patience for them to arrive.

There's Mr. Praed (Alvin Keith), who loves art; Sir George Crofts (Robert Cuccioli), Kitty's sketchy business partner; Reverend Samuel Gardner (Ralphael Nash Thompson), whose secret history with Kitty eventually emerges; and the clergyman's idle opportunist son Frank (a high-energy David Lee Huynh), whose romance with Vivie turns out to be too close for comfort."", ""An ongoing sight gag about Vivie's finger-numbing handshake accompaniess these introductions. It's a joke that goes practically nowhere unless it's to hint that this confident, Cambridge-educated young woman's resolve is just as ironclad. That becomes evident after two revelations. The first comes when Vivie, who's been afforded every advantage by a mother she doesn't even know, finds out that Kitty turned tricks to survive -- and to ensure her daughter's future. Vivie is okay with that. But Vivie can't accept that Kitty is still in the life —only as a madam with a fleet of lucrative brothels.

"‘Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992’ review — Anna Deavere Smith’s seminal work remains painfully resonant","Anna Deavere Smith is a singular artist. The transfiguration of journalistic interviews into documentary-style drama, a method Smith pioneered 30 years ago, redefined what it means to tell the truth on stage.

Smith conducted some 320 interviews in all; ', 'Twilight', ' first premiered in 1994, just two years after the L.A. riots.', ""Beneath projections that identify them by name and their relationship to events, characters tell us what they know, what they think, what they think they know. There's Angela King, Rodney King's aunt, who recalls private memories with her nephewand the moment she saw his body limp on the pavement through her television. There's Josie Morales, who witnessed the attack firsthand, and Ted Briseno, an officer accused in King's beating."", ""There are professors and thought leaders —including Cornel West and Maxine Waters —shop owners, victims, and hoity-toity Hollywood hot shots. To the extent that the breadth of Smith's interviews suggest comprehensiveness, cohesion is far from the aim. In their disparateness, Smith's subjects present a reflection like a shattered mirror, luminous but distorted, at times terrifying."", ""Splintering these interviewees into separate performances, primarily in the bodies of actors who match their identity markers, highlights the subjects' distance from each other in instructive ways. The tension of racial difference becomes visible and legible, much as audiences are used to seeing in other mediums. There is also something to be said for a broadening of opportunity to performersand the understanding that an actor of Asian descent, for example, brings to an Asian subject's point of view."", ""But there is a blood unity, and echo of shared humanity, to Smith's assemblage of diverse voices into solo performance that's lost in this revised ensemble version.

"'The Woman in Black' review — an old-fashioned, scary communal experience","I've experienced my share of Halloween-themed theatre(including ones where I was blindfolded). But what I've rarely experienced was a room where audience members screamed in fright from all directions. And they were not screaming because of anything typically scary, such as bloody scenes, murders, or anything ghoulish. Instead, the brilliance of "", 'The Woman in Black', 'is its use of old-fashioned jump scares and an immersive soundscape to make audiences shriek and jump in their seats.', 'The Woman in Black', "" is based on the Susan Hill gothic horror novel of the same name. It follows an accountant, Arthur Kipps, hired to review the accounts of the deceased Alice Drablow. He travels to Mrs. Drablow's country manor house to discover, in the manner of all great ghost stories, disturbing noises and a mysterious woman in black with a skeletal face. "", 'The Woman in Black', ' has all the tropes of gothic horror: a house in the middle of a formidable countryside, a room with a locked door holding a mysterious secret, and a woman gone mad haunting the house. And as Kipps explores the house, as an audience member, there's a urge to shout, ""Don't open the door!"" horror-film style.', 'Speaking of film, ', 'The Woman in Black', ' has been adapted for the screen multiple times, most notably including a 2012 adaptation starring Daniel Radcliffe. The stage version by Stephen Mallatratt was created in 1987 (and is currently the second-longest-running production on the West End). The stage version is notable in how it only uses three actors and the bare minimum of props to create an air of tension and fright. And Mallatratt also added a framing device: In his version Kipps (played by David Acton) has hired an actor (Ben Porter) to help him recreate the events of ', 'The Woman in Black.', ""It is unclear why Kipps would want to relive his trauma in such a visceral way. But the framing device does make the case for the show as a piece of theatre: There's an additional fright element in the play version not present in the book or films that will make your blood run cold."", 'Acton and Porter both reprise their roles from the West End. Porter plays the actor who plays the young Kipps, which may sound convoluted, but he is able to transition between his two roles gracefully. He also has a relatable quality: When he is scared, so is the audience. Acton plays the older Kipps and the other characters in the story, and he transforms well into all of themthrough a change of coats and also some remarkable accent work.', 'The sound design by Sebastian Frost also deserves special mention for its ability to transport the audience to the different locations, while making them jump at the most unexpected moments — these are sound effects you truly feel in your bones.', ""The third actor, who plays the eponymous woman in black, is uncredited and doesn't take a bow with the rest of the cast. It's understandable since the play wants to leave the audiences feeling like they too have seen a ghost. But considering that most of the work of frightening the audience falls on that actor's shoulders, and she more than succeeded judging by the screams of the audience around me, she should at the very least receive a credit in the playbill. And if the show doesn't want to ruin the surprise, wait until the audience goes home and then send them an electronic program."", 'This omission is particularly egregious considering that the show is very male-dominated: The cast, the director, and most of the crew members are men.

She plays off Falco's more subdued energy wonderfully, giving that relationship an understandable friction."", ""Falco has a different challenge. She has to play Charley in different stages of her life. This is where the script fails to support the astounding actors in the show. Falco is able to imbue Charley with a listlessness and sadness, giving that character depth and humanity through her face and body language.

"Review of Paris, written by Eboni Booth, at Atlantic Theater Company","Paris', ', the new work by emerging playwright ', 'Eboni Booth', ', has nothing to do with the City of Light. This slice-of-life drama is set in Paris, Vermont, a city of blight, where a group of superstore warehouse employees, circa 1995, struggle through their long shifts before heading to a second job, or to the bar, or disappearing altogether. The play, staged by the ', 'Atlantic Theater Company', ' at ', 'Atlantic Stage 2', ', percolates at a slow and even pace, under the sure direction of ', 'Knud Adams', ', as it establishes the plight of each of its seven characters. Which is not to say that everything is spelled out for the audience. Rather, the most effective moments are those with pieces missing, or where a line of brutish dialogue is met with only a simmering silence.', 'Gar (', 'Eddie K. Robinson', "") is the manager of the Paris outlet of Berry's, a Walmart-like retailer, but with a sketchier payroll department. Emmie ("", 'Jules Latimer', "") is his newest employee and, like him, a person of color. But unlike Gar, Emmie's face is deeply bruised and she seemingly has had some teeth knocked out. A fall on the ice? A fall on the ice after several vodkas? Or some other reason entirely? The absence of an explanation lends an air of mystery to newcomer Latimer's solid, understated performance. Gar, meanwhile, has secrets of his own, along with a gambling compulsion, mood swings, and the kind of collegial sense of humor that borders on harassment. Robinson's edgy performance results in a likable character that one nonetheless does not feel sorry for after he meets a worrisome fate."", ""Emmie's colleagues are all Caucasian and harbor prejudice in their bones to various degrees. While any overt racial outbreaks are kept in check by their communal state of always being broke, verbal jabs and punches are still thrown via Booth's skillful handling of the dialogue. Maxine (a dynamic "", 'Danielle Skraastad', ') is that type of loudmouth who is always cursing up a storm or complaining about something.

Review of Frankenstein at Classic Stage Company,"Though created 80 years apart, ', 'Mary Shelley', ""'s "", 'Frankenstein', ' ', 'and ', 'Bram Stoker', ""'s "", 'Dracula', ' ', 'are pop-cultural close cousins. Their gothic bond was forged in 1931, when each received its own horror flick treatment, with Boris Karloff cast as the monster born from the dead and Bela Lugosi as the vampire that would not die. Since then, the works have been satirized, sexualized, analyzed and animated. And now, the ', 'Classic Stage Company', ' resurrects them for the Off-Broadway stage, in a repertory cycle of two experimental, yet starkly different productions at the Lynn F.

', 'Rob Morrison', ' is the one-man chorus. He narrates, strums a few different string instruments that, if not exactly furthering the action, sets a mood, and voices a variety of doomed to be strangled characters. ', 'Stephanie Berry', ' portrays The Creature and if it is at first surprising that an African American woman is inhabiting the role, one realizes soon enough that when it comes to portraying the undead, any casting is against type.', ""Rather than forging any sort of contemporary sociological statement, the creative team has opted to let Shelley's work speak for itself. That is, once it learns to speak. The first quarter of the 80 minute one-act is primarily concerned with the creature coming to life, learning the joys and dangers of the natural world and very slowly gaining language skills. Thus, Berry does a lot of grunting and gesticulating. One clever moment successfully transforms the monster's moans into an understanding of music, but it is otherwise a long slog."", 'Once the creature has grasped English, words spill forth in full Victorian splendor. Bernays has picked the meatiest swaths of Shelley's novel and serves them up in heightened language, primarily in narrative passages spoken directly to the audience. ""I left the woods in the deep decay of autumn and trudged into the bare bones of winter, the earth beneath me hard as my heart."" The storytelling is pleasing to the ear yet, as staged, the misery of both the monster and the monster builder is undercut by a lack of theatricality and seemingly intentional deadpan manner. Not helping matters, the essence of Dr. Victor Frankenstein is scattered.

When Berry suddenly takes over the representation, it is more confusing than enlightening.', 'John Doyle, the fine musical director who is bringing ', 'Assassins', ' ', 'to CSC in April, pitches in as scenic designer. His sparse offerings include a large table that works well as the slab upon which the brute takes its first breaths, but then mostly just gets in the way.

Review of Evita at New York City Center,"The legacy and history of the Broadway genre is defined most by its divas: Broadway's brightest and most archetypal stars have been women. They are charismatic, larger than life, and have voices that bring crowds to their knees and to their feet. Moreover, they are immense cultural properties that hold a special place in the hearts of those they reach."", 'Both the titular character and source material of ', 'Evita', ' reflect this principle. Eva Perón, as a complex political figure, has endured as an international cultural icon, inspiring this very musical. Her career as an entertainer-turned-politician, with its engrossed public and cult of celebrity, was marked with as much controversy as glamour.', ""Perhaps it's for this reason that, in her effort to revitalize "", 'Evita', ' for contemporary audiences at ', 'New York City Center', ', ', 'Sammi Cannold', "" has us re-examine what we feel about the glitz, and the woman behind it. Cannold's heavily researched approach pervades in this new streamlined rendition. Cuts and transitions make for a trim, two-hour runtime that leaves no dull moments. At worst, it's in want of a little breathing room. Cannold's incisive truthfulness zeroes in on the uglier facets of Perón's story—behind her talent and sexual power lie trauma and victimization at a young age. Behind the champion of descamisados and women's suffrage was also the wife of Perón's oppressive regime."", 'All this culminates in a rendition perhaps a little darker than even the grand, emotional weight of the score is accustomed to. From the moment audiences enter the theatre, they see Perón's iconic white Dior dress: Recreated by Alejo Vietti, suspended above Jason Sherwood's piers of white roses. Like Evita's hands, they are a saintly, ethereal, almost virginal gesture. This same almost-monument is eviscerated in the end by the same ensemble that not long ago so sensationalized Evita; as her own mortality looms, and her vacillating legacies echoes to haunting chants of ""Perón"". The audience, watching a reduced Eva on her deathbed, with her younger counterpart in a fetal position nearby, cannot help but wonder: Are we complicit?', ""Cannold's storytelling is complemented by all her collaborators, and a satisfyingly Latin-dominant cast. Evita's younger self is delegated to a separate actress: "", 'Maia Reficco', ""'s supple, poppy vocals as Young Eva deftly cycle "", 'Andrew Lloyd Webber', ""'s challenging score, but without much depth of character. However, despite an early transition to "", 'Solea Pfeiffer', ""'s stellar Eva, Reficco's presence throughout the rest of the show as a haunting, introspective shadow of Eva's past is no less potent. "", 'Jason Gotay', ""'s Che is fiercely sung, but lacking the gravitas and grit of former interpreters. "", 'Maria Cristina', ' ', 'Slye', ', inversely, delivers an achingly show-stealing ""Another Suitcase In Another Hall.""All this is under Bradley King's colorful lighting, which dabbles frequently with Eva's mortal white and a menacing, Sith Lord-esque red for the more politically charged scenes.', 'This distilling of an aging but timeless classic, with boldness and authenticity at its forefront, could not be truer to the directive of New York City Center.', '(Photoby Joan Marcus)', '', '""Cannold's interpretation, based in part on work she did for her undergraduate thesis at Stanford, is even more analytical than Prince's.

Racism, homophobia, the disregard for protocol, betrayal of foreign allegiances, and the demand for loyalty - these are chilling and not lost on any of us.Kushner, however, insists on driving the points home using Xillah and Zillah's sidebar conversations. These are labeled ""Interruptions"" in the script and become the didactic portions of the play.So dense that they bring the show to a slow halt.Over and over again.', 'The story is clear enough.As Germany begins to crumble, we watch the safety net unravel, bit by bit. Political parties are outlawed. People are taken away never to be seen again.Food is scarce. The powers are closing in on anyone not toeing the line.The life options soon become either leave the country (find the holes in the borders) and end your life as you know it, or end your life - period.

It's less gimmicky than you'd think! When a self-inserted "", 'David Henry Hwang', ' is stabbed in the neck immediately following the election of [Not Hillary Clinton], he conceives a vision of such a show: One that takes every single trope of the white-savior-travels-to-exotic-country narrative, and flips it on its head. Xue Xing, a Shanghai-based producer of musicals, is sent to New York to oversee the adaptation of a popular Chinese film into a Broadway musical (written by DHH's own fever dream counterpart). When Xue is introduced to Hillary Clinton at a reception, a 'King and I' scenario develops, complete with its own ""Shall We Dance"" scene about learning the tones in Mandarin.

Are the Americans portrayed as caricatures? Does the ""New Silk Road"" ending of the fantasy musical, wherein America lays down its arms to enter the future under Chinese guidance, seem slightly propagandist? Does it echo the implicit colonialism of Xi Jingping's own ""Belt and Road"" initiative?

Review of Lincoln Center Theater's LCT3 production of In the Green,"Being a kid in medieval Germany was no day at the beach, especially if you were Hildegard von Bingen.

For a certain generation, that sweltering image, and the song that encompasses it (""', 'Paradise by the Dashboard Light', '""), was the ultimate adolescent aspirational anthem, a jokey double-dare of sex and commitment aimed at kids barely old enough to drive or to rock.

Review of Admissions by Joshua Harmon at Lincoln Center Theater,"Admissions', "", Joshua Harmon's interesting, if ultimately limited, discourse on the perils of white male privilege, is now playing at the "", 'Mitzi E. Newhouse', ' at Lincoln Center. The production, directed by Daniel Aukin, submits a compelling application for higher education without actually making it all the way out of prep school.', 'The action of the play takes place at and near Hillcrest, a New England boarding/prep school whose Headmaster, Bill Mason (', 'Andrew Garman', '), is married to the Admissions Director, Sherri Rosen-Mason (', 'Jessica Hecht', '). She has labored throughout her tenure at Hillcrest to increase the diversity of the predominantly white student body, and is finally enjoying the fruits of these efforts as the percentage of minority students for the incoming class has finally approached the 20% mark. That good news is overshadowed by the disappointing deferral letter her Hillcrest senior son Charlie (', 'Ben Edelman', ') has received from Yale, which he had set his heart upon, and the simultaneous acceptance into Yale by his best friend Perry, whose father is black. Charlie has also been overlooked for the Editor position at the school newspaper, which went to a female less qualified, and he is unable to synthesize his feelings of frustration and rejection with his liberal parents' professional commitment to the values of affirmative action and inclusion. This interesting dilemma provokes an intense family outburst in the kitchen of the Mason home; naturally, his parents want what's best for him, but Charlie is throwing it right back at them. At one point, he says ""Can you honestly spare me your liberal guilty white bullshit for two seconds and hear what I'm saying?"" They take it right on the chin, like the good liberal sorts that they are, as he goes on an extensive rant about the unfairness of the quota-reliant admissions system that they have helped to construct - for his own failure. Bill Mason tasks his son with being a privileged brat who has had everything handed to him, but when Charlie goes storming off to his room, his parents set to work on pulling strings to help him get into a good college. This ""liberal hypocrisy"" doesn't appear to work out terribly well, even when Charlie finally lands a slot at Middlebury College, because by that time Charlie has decided to go to a community college and have his parents donate the money that they would have spent on his education to create a scholarship for an under-privileged minority student.Charlie gets it: in order to give someone a seat at the table, someone else has to give up their place.That's not flying with his parents, though it would seem to be a living expression of everything they stand for, and upon this impasse this ultimately frustrating domestic drama ends, with Charlie storming off again to his room.', ""The cast is excellent, on the whole, though Mr. Edelman needs to master some vocal technique in order to make his way through his longer tirades; given at the decibel-splitting level he is attempting, I worry he won't make it through eight shows a week.

Review of The Play That Goes Wrong at New World Stages,"Halfway through the first act of the hilarious off-Broadway staging of ', 'The Play That Goes Wrong', ', an actor who has grown wildly frustrated because of a missing prop turns to the audience and says, ""Stop laughing! This isn't television, I can see you."" The demand, naturally, only makes the audience laugh harder. And that is an impressive feat given that the chuckles had been pouring forth relentlessly from the production's opening moments and, indeed, carry through to the final madcap meltdown, with the scenery seemingly in a race with the performers to see which will tip over first. If it is cliché to say that a show has non-stop laughs, then this show is cliché in the extreme. If it is pat to say that this play lives up to its title, rarely have a talented crew of actors and technicians so seamlessly joined forces to make a ridiculously wrong piece of theater feel so very right.', 'The script, by a trio of gents who trained at the London Academy of Music & Dramatic Art, actually has a rather complicated exoskeleton. It is a play within a play, with actors portraying other actors who, in turn, are portraying characters in a murder mystery. It is an Agatha Christie type of an affair where one dead body turns into two, then back into one, then into several, while siblings, friends, a love interest and, of course, the butler, are all scrutinized by an intrepid inspector (a game for anything ', 'Matt Harrington', '). But none of this matters in the least. It is merely an excuse for two hours of well-timed spit takes, killer pratfalls, silly antics by men with serious British accents, pyrotechnics of both the literal and metaphorical variety, purposefully egregious over-acting and death defying moments of scenic design by Tony Award winner ', 'Nigel Hook', '.

An ensemble of eight perform the tricky task of bashing each other while making sure their antics are safely executed.
