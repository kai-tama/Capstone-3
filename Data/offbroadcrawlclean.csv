The real history behind ‘Purlie Victorious’ on Broadway,"Discover how real-life people, places, and politics shaped Ossie Davis’s uproarious comedy from 1961, which remains just as fresh and relevant in 2023.', 'Sometimes the dividing line between a character and a playwright is a blurry one. So it is with Ossie Davis’s 1961 satirical comedy ', 'Purlie Victorious: A Non-Confederate Romp Through the Cotton Patch', ', now back on Broadway for the first time since its debut 62 years ago.', 'The story follows Purlie Victorious Judson, a Black self-made traveling preacher who returns to his segregated Georgia hometown with a mission to buy and rehab its derelict church, Big Bethel. As a Black man, that’s a tall order. The church, like the town, is in the grip of racist tyrant Ol’ Cap’n Cotchipee.', 'Davis grew up in racially segregated Georgia. Like Purlie, Davis had first-hand experience with discrimination and bigotry, forces that inform the play and fueled his lifelong commitment to civil rights. In a pre-show voiceover, director Kenny Leon notes that the play began as an angry drama. But it evolved to become less autobiographical and funnier. Get people laughing, you get people’s attention. That’s powerful.', 'Learn more about the political and personal contexts – and the impact of 1960s-era influences – that shaped ', 'Purlie Victorious', ' below.', 'Get ', 'Purlie Victorious', ' tickets', ' now.', 'Davis situated his play in Georgia in the late 1950s, a time when Jim Crow – which has been called “a racial caste system” – were in effect in the American South. Bottom line: Blacks were second-class citizens.', '“Jim Crow was more than a series of rigid anti-black laws. It was a way of life,” according to the ', 'Jim Crow Museum', ', a resource to tell the story of African American resiliency. Jim Crow bolstered the lie that Blacks were inferior to whites.', 'Davis shrewdly creates Ol\' Cap\'n Cotchipee to be the flesh-and-blood manifestation of Jim Crow, a man dressed head to toe in white who won’t hesitate to say he reveres “all that is white and holy” – and that doesn’t include African Americans. He sums the philosophy up in a chilling line: ""My ol\' Confederate father told me on his deathbed: Feed the Negras first - after the horses and cattle.""', 'Cotchipee is quick to reach for his bullwhip, but he takes a shine to Purlie’s brother Gitlow (that name is no accident), an “Uncle Tom” who’s content being subservient and keeping to the old-plantation-day ways.', 'But Davis leaves room for hope. Cotchipee’s liberal-minded son Charlie has had it with his father’s bigoted ways – and that ultimately leads the way for Purlie to get the last laugh.', ""Purlie’s plan to take ownership of Big Bethel requires a secret weapon – Lutiebelle Gussie Mae Jenkins, a follower and love interest of Purlie's who’s game for anything.

It’s the inaugural year of the Women’s National Basketball Association, and the five fiery players believe the WNBA is their ticket out of the dusty dirt courts. There are just a few obstacles to getting to the sleek, hardwood courts of the professional basketball league. For one, April Jenkins (Brittany Bellizeare) is pregnant.', 'Team captain Starra Jones (Erica Matthews), motivated by her late mother’s basketball success, is determined to have the full team play at the state championship game. She holds a “pregnancy practice,” the teammates sport fake belly bump suits lifted from the school’s home economics classroom while running drills. The goal is to prove to the team’s coach that April can participate. It doesn’t work.', 'But more stands between the girls and the state championship game: a ruthless act of betrayal, a burgeoning romance, an identity crisis, and an inflated ego. The team’s journey to forgive one another and build trust is as gripping as a close basketball game.', 'One of the play’s strongest scenes takes place at a sleepover. Sidney Brown (Tamera Tomakili) reads from a pornographic magazine and demonstrates how to put condoms onto fruits and vegetables to a hilarious effect.

'The Half-God of Rainfall' review — mythologies collide in this poetic epic,"Read our four-star review of Inua Ellams's "", 'The Half-God of Rainfall', ', a Greek and African mythology-inspired play playing off Broadway at New York Theatre Workshop.', 'Blending Nigerian and Greek mythologies, Inua Ellams’s ', 'The Half-God of Rainfall', ' sees multiple gods step forward from a seven-person ensemble. It is rare that the trust and communication among an ensemble shines through in their work, but the cast of ', 'Half-God', ' seems to meld and move together, even when their characters are in conflict. Much of this charismatic connection comes from movement director Orlando Pabotoy’s choreography, which turns Ellams’s epic poem into dance theatre. Taibi Magar directs the thoughtful, meticulous ', 'New York Theatre Workshop', ' and American Repertory Theater co-production.', 'For those weary of Greek theatre, take heart in the fact that ', 'Half-God', ' grounds its story in basketball, using the sport as the backdrop for a war between men and mortals. Nigerian children, including Demi (Mister Fitzgerald), take the sport seriously and try to make their neighborhood games NBA-caliber; Demi is helped by his supernatural strength and precision, as he is the son of Zeus (Michael Laurence).', 'A journey to California and then the Olympics solidifies Demi’s place in basketball history, but other gods believe he is cheating. Nigerian American player Hakeem Olajuwon (Jason Bowen) appears to Demi and confesses that all great players are really half-gods, but that they’d signed a pact to stop competing with humans after Michael Jordan took flight on the court. “Grandfather had to wipe memories,” he says. The storyline mocks the grandeur of American sports culture, but never in a patronizing way, as if Ellams is in on the joke.', 'Audience members don’t have to be well-versed in basketball to appreciate the allegory of the game, which Sángó, a Nigerian thunder god, trains for by reading ', 'The Art of War', '. The actors narrate their characters’ actions and also speak their dialogue, which at times is superfluous and confusing. But Ellams’s language flows, for the most part, like Pabotoy’s choreography and the luscious fabric that symbolizes rivers stage. Like the ensemble, the show’s designers collaborate to create one cohesive being, with each discipline still allowed its moment in the spotlight, like scenic designer Riccardo Hernández’s rain or costume designer Linda Cho’s Statue of Liberty-inspired gown for the Yoruba river goddess Osún (Patrice Johnson Chevannes). Tal Yarden’s projection design is particularly adept, drawing in the audience with recurring motifs that keep us grounded in specific locations or times.', 'In the end, the story is led not by Demi, but by his mother Modúpé (Jennifer Mogbock, who also serves as dance captain), a priestess of Osún who captivates the power-hungry Zeus. Like other women before her, Modúpé becomes a victim of Zeus, bearing a half-god and wavering between grief and joy, content with her child but saddled with the weight of his violent conception. Pabotoy’s choreography for this violence is a reminder of the power of gesture, exchanging the literal for the subtler but piercing hearts all the same.', 'It is Modúpé’s pain and power that leads the story to a climax, though the phrasing of the concluding feminist faceoff is a bit awkward. The stilted dialogue threatens to undercut ', 'Half-God', '’s impact, but Magar’s production is too beautiful to be held down for long.

'Let's Call Her Patty' review — Leslie Kritzer adds comedic meat to thin play,"Read our review of Zarina Shea's "", ""Let's Call Her Patty"", ', starring Rhea Perlman, Leslie Rodriguez Kritzer, and Arielle Goldman, off Broadway through August 27.', 'Comedian and actor Rhea Perlman’s return to the stage seems tailor-made for her: She plays the title character in Zarina Shea’s ', 'Let’s Call Her Patty', "", a show about an Upper West Side woman who wields kitchen knives and a Brooklyn accent with aplomb. It is not Perlman's fault that the LCT3 play, now running at the "", 'Claire Tow Theater', ' and directed by Margot Bordelon, is lacking any substance to sustain the character’s witticisms.', 'Let’s Call Her Patty', ' is narrated by Sammy (Leslie Rodriguez Kritzer in classic form), Patty’s niece. Though Patty doesn’t agonize over Sammy’s every decision as she does with her biological daughter, she did raise Sammy after the death of her sister, Sammy’s mother. Sammy tells the audience repeatedly that a place makes a person — that is, that Patty is shaped by her Upper West Side environs, and that her personality would be different if she lived in, for example, Arizona with retirees and Sammy’s wife’s dying mother.', 'Patty is a walking Upper West Side stereotype: a Jewish woman of a certain age who doesn’t work, who has a car but doesn’t like to drive it, who takes a plethora of exercise classes and frets over her appearance. She’s a Democrat, but not too left-leaning. She’s Jewish, but not in a way that seems to matter to the plot; she just likes to kvetch at her unseen husband and eat Chinese takeout and complain about the JCC. Her relationship to New York is similarly superficial, defined only by its punchlines.', 'Despite its shortcomings of both delivery and development, ', 'Let’s Call Her Patty', ' is rife with plot: Patty learns her daughter Cecile (Arielle Goldman), a wayward artist who has perhaps inherited her mother’s disordered eating patterns, has a drug problem. We don’t know how or when it started, only that it’s escalated and that rehab is expensive and ineffective. (This is a notable problem in a country where the for-profit drug treatment model dominates, though this is not the focus of the play.)', 'Goldman is given almost no time to convey her struggles or indeed anything meaningful about her character. She communicates her anxiety most often through physical tics rather than dialogue, an interesting premise that suffers simply because Cecile is not onstage enough. The play isn’t about her, but Patty; but really, it’s about Sammy, or the tenuous ties among the women. ', 'Let’s Call Her Patty', ' isn’t grounded enough to feel like it’s about anything.', ""Its monologues feel like they were written just to be monologues (every audience member at Lincoln Center knows about climate change; paragraphs reminding us of its existence aren't revolutionary or even interesting). Shea seems to have written Patty so that an actor like Perlman could sell tickets to other Upper West Siders. A place makes a person insofar as the Upper West Side makes theatregoers with disposable incomes."", 'Kritzer is the production’s saving grace, a study in both perfectly timed delivery and physical comedy. She drops to the floor and rolls under set pieces like a school child in a fire drill, winks at the howling audience as she wisecracks about Patty, and convinces us that an unseen dog is truly onstage. Already a veteran character actor sculpted in the likeness of Perlman, Kritzer carries the play as it meanders and then abruptly concludes. Though Perlman’s comedic chops still shine in some moments, Kritzer’s Sammy is both the heart and humor of the piece. Neither talent, however, is enough to make up for ', 'Let’s Call Her Patty', '’s creative stagnation.', 'Let’s Call Her Patty', ' is at the Claire Tow Theater through August 27.

She’s in physical agony, and the same goes for Eileen. The divide between how things look and the way things are is one takeaway of this group portrait of pain and its life-rattling reverberations.', 'The May 2019 setting is a clinic a couple hours north of San Francisco, where six people in their 40s and up have arrived from near and far. They’re here to fast, rest, and recuperate from various health woes that invaded their lives.', 'Over several days they trade banalities (“What are you reading?”) and who-knew factoids (“We also have tiny sphincters in our eyes”). They swap war stories, at times graphically, of how their bodies have betrayed them (“Whenever I pee, it’s like I’m peeing razors”). They ask questions (“Who are the happy normal people?” and “Are you all right, sweetheart?”) that defy easy answers and are surprisingly stirring in their directness.', 'That’s basically it, and it all happens on a relatively nondescript open-air patio featuring floral breeze blocks and a row of cushioned chaise lounges. At some point during the play’s unbroken 105 minutes, a sense of isolation sinks in. One might imagine those seats as life rafts – built for one.

He strolls shirtless into the patio, sparking ogling that recalls the likes of Lucky Vanous, the hunk from the Diet Coke ad. Nelson adds carbonation, particularly for Sofi.', 'As always, Baker serves up a distinct slice of life and takes her time with it. One of the play’s clever conceits is its tinkering with time.

On the other, the re-emergence of fanged fiction means that we as a society really are drowning in a wave of conservative politics."", 'Rosen and Greenberg, who co-authored the script while the latter also directs, seem to be aware of ditching the narrative fidelity to the novel in favor of remixing the source material’s target of social critique. If the Victorians were a repressed, sexist, and Machiavellian social order, ', 'Dracula: A Comedy of Terrors', ' makes a burlesque of their anxieties and fears. Jonathan Harker (Andrew Keenan-Bolger) is a coward, prissy real estate agent, most fearful of himself; Lucy Westfeldt (Kaitlyn Boyer) is an ambitious botanist relegated to marrying Harker; her father Dr. Westfeldt (Ellen Harvey, maybe miscast) is exploiting the mentally ill in his sanatorium; her sister Mina (Arnie Burton) is horny and desperately unmarried; and even Van Helsing (Burton again) is a woman doctor.', 'Dracula', '’s humor exaggerates the tautness between the strictures of social rules and rituals, the archetypes they create, and what happens when they’re transgressed. That kind of observation turned into absurdity feels best embodied by Daly’s Dracula. Daly is unafraid to make his ivory features a liability: he pouts his lips or falls to the ground gracelessly, which makes his performance all the more impressive.', 'His emotionally adolescent Dracula converges with the play’s attempt at engaging in the more serious business of wanting to liberate oneself from the very societal constraints the characters inhabit. While he’s experiencing an existential crisis in his desire for everything (and thus commitment to nothing), the rest of the ensemble’s desires occasionally come into focus. It’s Boatman who most effortlessly conveys this tonal transition of a woman who is torn between love and a bit of self-reliance and curiosity, but also between the genres Dracula situates itself within, like firecracker comedy and wailing melodrama.', 'The show makes it difficult to begrudge pointing out the occasional imprecise, maybe, I’ll say it, potentially transphobic “man in a dress” nature to some of the jokes because, after all, it advertises itself as a gender-bending reenvisioning of the text.

Wilson MCC Theater Space through October 7.', 'There is a lot of irony in ', 'Mary Gets Hers', ', a new play by Emma Horwitz running at ', 'MCC Theater', ' in a Playwrights Realm production. It is ironic to stage a play about a raging plague that “turned people into foam” a few years after the theatre industry shut down because of Covid-19. Horwitz seems to revel in this irony, showing off the tongue-in-cheek sadness of the child Mary (Haley Wong) and, later, her more frank devastation. It is also ironic, however, that ', 'Mary Gets Hers', ' gives us no reason to root for the title character beyond pitying her childhood circumstances.', 'Years after the death of her parents, Mary does not appear to have any desires beyond wanting them back – a reasonable wish for a real child, but not a compelling one for a protagonist. Most of the other characters are fleshed out with hopes, fears, insecurities, and ambitions, like the religious hermit Abraham (Susannah Perkins), who wants to prove himself to God and his mentor by procuring a pure virgin child for the abbey. Ephraim (Octavia Chavez-Richmond), his mentor, has arguments with God that form the core of the show’s heart.

Spooky choreography lends the production a heightened air of near-Expressionism as the ensemble acts out Abraham’s nightmare of Mary’s worldly defilement. Lighting cues from Cha See further up the tension in Josiah Davis’s adept and entertaining production.

'Toros' review — a bullish trio of friends locks horns,"Read our review of Danny Tejera's "", 'Toros', "", this year's Second Stage Theater Uptown Series production, at the McGinn/Cazale Theater through August 13."", ""I couldn't get out of the 90-degree heat fast enough as the gloriously air-conditioned "", 'McGinn/Cazale Theater', ' beckoned.

At least for the next 90 minutes, albeit hit-and-miss ones, I was in Madrid."", 'That may seem glamorous to us Americans, but as rendered by set designer Arnulfo Maldonado in Danny Tejera\'s play, the Spanish capital is no different than a suburban hometown, perhaps the kind your high school self longed to escape. All we see of it is an unfinished garage-turned-living space: A desk and laptop serve as the ""office"" (read: amateur DJ booth) of 26-year-old Juan (Juan Castano), who also makeshifts a living room from a loveseat, coffee table, and plastic chair, sandwiched in the space between the ""office,"" his parents\' Audi, and lots of garden-variety junk.', 'It’s stuffed bordering on stifling. ', 'Toros', ' takes place over the course of a few pregames Juan hosts for his friends Toro (Abubakr Ali) and Andrea (b), an appropriate setup, as we meet these characters at transitional phases before they move on to other things — or try to. Juan isn’t particularly happy about playing host — or living in the garage at all — preferring to devote his attention to practicing his (unimpressive) DJing so he can finally make it out. That’s about all he’ll do, though. Toro at least escaped to New York, but crippling disillusionment with life brought him back. And Andrea, a kindergarten teacher with roots in multiple countries, now searches for stability, looking for it in the wrong people: these high school friends who should have all long outgrown each other.', ""We immediately get that sense upon Andrea’s arrival, when Juan starts relentlessly mocking Toro for his crush on her in order to mask his own. Things escalate from there, as Juan's trying to mask a lot more than that: a self-destructive impulse to push everyone else away; a deep insecurity in himself; an unwillingness to take any responsibility for the harm he inflicts on others, physical and emotional. Problem is, we never quite learn why, though there’s clearly more going on than a half-requited crush. Following a climatic incident (after which the play goes on 15 minutes too long), he offers a stunned Andrea a vague spiel about going through mental and emotional trouble. It's not a specific or deep enough reason to invest in him as a character."", 'All the characters, to a degree, feel underwritten. Toro and Andrea exist mostly as collateral damage in Juan’s self-destruction. They do get the play’s best scene: a vulnerable conversation in which they reveal their Tragic Backstories and probe meaty ideas about whether life is worth living — or ""real"" at all — if we\'re always doing what\'s expected of us. But one scene does not a full character — or thought-provoking play — make, especially as their last onstage conversation is mostly small talk. To Tejera\'s credit, neither their lofty debate nor their awkward patter feels like a playwright\'s hand at work; he has a knack for authentic dialogue.', ""Director Gaye Taylor Upchurch's production is nonetheless buoyed by its cast, particularly the effortlessly magnetic b. Alongside the trio is Frank Wood as Juan's aging dog, Tica. While Wood is commendably game, the presence of the dog is mostly distracting, her intended significance unclear until she, too, becomes a pivotal plot device in service of Juan’s arc."", 'The play ends on an abrupt and ambiguous note, Juan mysteriously far from the action even as his presence still looms large in the garage despite all the other characters actually being there. It’s the time we most want to see him, to finally understand the reason for his anger and its impact not just on the others, but on himself. We still never get it. It’s not fully out of Tejera’s reach, though — with a little deepening of character, ', 'Toros', ' has potential to charge forward.', 'Toros', ' is at the McGinn/Cazale Theater through August 13.', 'Photo credit: Juan Castano and b in Toros.

In her glittery silver pantsuit, Bloom dribbles a basketball, poses coyly under a parasol, and tries to rock a makeshift baby to sleep without killing it. She asserts her desire to perform a show written in 2019, one that relies on hacky jokes to establish a pre-pandemic world order, until an interloper forces her to confront reality.', '“The world is back to normal,” she proclaims near the top of the show, then admits later, when discussing the Covid surge affecting audience members right now, that the world is not normal. It never will be again.', 'Perhaps this lack of normalcy explains why Bloom can’t find her footing onstage, a place where she has historically been both comfortable and confident. ', 'Death, Let Me Do My Show', ' is part stand-up comedy, part musical theatre extravaganza, and part confessional, and its effect is as disjointed as these elements.', 'Fans of her television series ', 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend', ' may be surprised: The show that brought Bloom an Emmy Award and a cult following blended flashy music numbers about mental illness with irreverent humor that flew in the face of network sitcom rules. In ', 'Death', ', Bloom doesn’t achieve this same balance of tones, and is in fact accused by Death himself (embodied as a heckler in the form of her ', 'Crazy Ex', ' costar David Hull) of avoiding difficult conversations.', 'This most difficult conversation is known to any ', 'Crazy Ex', ' fan in the audience: the death of the songwriter Adam Schlesinger, Bloom’s writing partner. In March 2020, Bloom gave birth a daughter who was unable to breathe and was placed on a ventilator, while across the country, Schlesinger fell victim to the first wave of Covid and was also intubated. Soon after Bloom brought her daughter home from the NICU, Schlesinger died.', 'This one-two punch sprouted in Bloom a new fear of death. She feared her daughter would die in her sleep or that her dog would die before her child had memories of it — leading her to pepper a corner of the nursery with commissioned paintings of the pooch. She wasn’t afraid she’d be haunted by the ghosts of those she’d lost (including a colleague and her psychiatrist in quick succession after Schlesinger), but that she would never be.', '“Is a Civil War soldier whose face has been destroyed really as scary as an unfeeling void?” she asks of the afterlife in “The Spookiest Scariest Ghost,” a Halloween parody song and the only number that marries witty and macabre in her signature style.', 'The rest of the show feels incohesive, particularly the banter between Bloom and Hull, which comes across as unfinished in more of a missed deadline manner than an improv comedy one. Seth Barrish of the Barrow Group directs, but leaves no personal touch.', 'The show instead leaves the impression that Bloom is rushing to process grief, joy, and the last decade of her career before the pop culture moment moves on.

Thankfully, she goes back to baking.', 'Audible Theater’s production of ', 'Swing State', ', now off Broadway at the ', 'Minetta Lane Theatre', "", first bowed at Chicago’s Goodman Theatre last year. Under the deft direction of Robert Falls, the all-star cast mines the play's themes of loss, longing, and depression with a quiet edge and surprising humor."", 'Swing State', ', named in part for its divisive political setting in Wisconsin, also represents the liminal space between two opposing truths. Peg, a recent widow, swings from bouts of depression to sprinkles of hope. As the steward of a nearly 50-acre prairie, she delights in observing the cone flowers bloom and the sunrise over the bluff. She also feels despair that fewer nighthawks, monarch butterflies, and chorus frogs inhabit the endangered ecosystem.', 'Peg’s neighbor Ryan (Bubba Weiler) also swings between disparate states. The young man is protective of Peg, and he also seeks her support as he eases back into work and sobriety after serving time for a felony battery conviction. In one scene, when Ryan experiences a panic attack, Peg kneels beside him and leads him through a breathing exercise. She asks if she can help him find a counselor. “Why would I need a counselor when I got you?” he retorts.', 'Peg and her late husband, Jim, became surrogate parents to Ryan and visited him in prison. They even paid taxes on his house so that he’d have a home to return to. Peg, a former school guidance counselor, wants every species on the prairie to have a home to return to. She’s anxiously waiting for the Henslow’s Sparrow to migrate back to the land to nest. She tills the prairie, hoping wildflowers will sprout from season to season, finding a permanent home in the tall grass.', 'As part of her desire to preserve and promote life on the prairie, Peg asks Ryan to sign her will, which stipulates that he’ll receive her house and three acres, and a non-profit organization will take ownership of the remaining prairie land. “You’re being morbid as shit!” exclaims Ryan when she presents the paperwork.', 'Peg’s carefully laid out end-of-life plans falter when she discovers her late husband’s tools and prized Winchester rifle are missing from the barn.

Will the depressed artist die, or the diabetic whose symptoms are rapidly increasing? How about the unstable, PTSD-laden veteran, or the anesthesiologist with an alcohol problem? The show is a puzzle begging you to solve it and clocking your distraction as you try.', 'Death, who inhabits the characters at various points, becomes a reprieve from the awkward tension of missed connections and the escalation of conflict as Emilio (Caleb Eberhardt) tears everyone down, determined to destroy what remains of his relationships.', 'Emilio is smart and apparently a great artist, but he is also insufferable, spouting off societal observations like he’s the first to ever voice them. He is sometimes oblivious to his patronizing tone, though sometimes seems aware of how much he hurts his old friends, goading them until they snap. He directs much of his ire at Caitlin (Susannah Flood), his former best friend and confidante whom he now resents for marrying a “shithead” instead of him.', 'Though the friends gather together for their 20th high school reunion, they remain alone. Caitlin has lost her husband to online conspiracy theories, Emilio harbors a secret about his own relationship, Ursula’s (Brittany Bradford) social life shrank since she lost vision in one eye, and Kristina (Shannon Tyo) shunned her husband and turned to alcohol to cope with the trauma of intubating Covid patients.', 'The only one who insists he’s fine is Paco (Bobby Moreno), a veteran and Caitlin’s high school boyfriend who shows up at the pre-reunion gathering unannounced. (“But he wasn’t in our class,” Emilio protests when Kristina drags Paco, who is also her cousin, to the nostalgia-laden party on Ursula’s porch.) Though 20 years have gone by, Emilio remains obsessed with his friend group’s identity as MERGE, the Multi-Ethnic Reject Group Experience, a moniker he’s apparently clung to while his friends have grown up and moved on (though most have remained in their hometown).', 'Jacobs-Jenkins’s characters employ an ironic device when one believes another is “harshing the buzz” or “rambling”: They pretend to kill each other, snapping their necks and stabbing one another when someone’s joke gets old or they’re too stoned to know how long they’ve been talking. No one took this approach to Jacobs-Jenkins’s script, though director Eric Ting cut at least 10 minutes of runtime before press performances. Though its dialogue is sharp and its characters memorable, ', 'The Comeuppance', ' tries to hold down too many conversations at once, stretching an arm into every pot.', 'Not every thread ties up in the end; Emilio’s fixation on the Columbine shooting comes through in both his hatred of the military and his violent outbursts, but a tale of his desire to photograph reactions to the September 11 attacks falls flat. In the story, told via phone by Simon, a friend who couldn’t make the reunion, Emilio seizes on the news of 9/11 as an opportunity to document the reactions of his classmates, hoping he can win a Pulitzer Prize. He regrets the incident now.', 'So why include it? Emilio laments that he abandoned photography because he “got tired of realism,” but Jacobs-Jenkins has Simon list current events in a monologue: Trump, Covid, Roe v. Wade, phenomena both the characters and audience already understand. Is Emilio trying to distance himself from such obviousness in his own art, or is he embracing it? ', 'The Comeuppance', ' is in some ways a beautiful meditation on millennial angst and in other ways an unfinished and wavering examination of it.

As it charts the rise and fall of Alan Freed, a legendary deejay who broke racial barriers in the 1950s and popularized rhythm and blues with mainstream audiences, it creaks as often as it rocks thanks to a predictable script and uneven mix of music.', 'Fortunately, the show has saving graces. One is the easy-to-like Constantine Maroulis leading the way as Freed. Known for playing an ’80s hair band member in the musical ', 'Rock of Ages', ', Maroulis is an able actor and singer (even in a wig that seems to have dropped from the sky). He hits the right notes as the show covers Freed’s eventful career.', 'The show’s other big asset is the ’50s music that Freed spun on air and aggressively promoted. Evergreen earworms like “Peggy Sue,” “Roll Over Beethoven,” and “Great Balls of Fire” come fast and furious in concert sequences when cast members stand in for the likes of early rock and roll icons Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, and Jerry Lee Lewis.', 'Other sonic highlights come from a group of singers who nail the rich and velvety harmonies on such familiar songs as “Sixty Minute Man” and “Smoke Gets In Your Eyes.” Valisia LeKae stands out as the fiery R&B singer LaVern Baker, who serves up her hits including “Tweedle Dee” and “Jim Dandy.” Expect head-bobbing from the audience.', 'On the other hand, ', 'Rock & Roll Man', ' gets rough around the edges when it comes to its original songs. Gary Kupper’s compositions turn up as garden-variety ballads and place-fillers instead of driving the story. They’re no match for the oldies but still goodies.', 'The story, by Kupper, Larry Marshak, and Rose Caiola, seizes upon the well-worn idea that life flashes before your eyes before you die. In Freed’s final vision, he imagines he and his legacy are on trial for crimes against the world. Yes, there was a time when rock music was considered a threat to society.', 'Freed’s defense lawyer is – good golly! – Little Richard (Rodrick Covington, a bit too cartoonish). The prosecutor is G-Man J. Edgar Hoover (a growly Bob Ari), who had Freed in his crosshairs.', 'The fever dream device is really just a way to flash back to watch Freed’s life unfold in predictable “and then this happened” fashion. We see Freed go from a Cleveland disc jockey playing mainstream tunes in the early 1950s to a radio sensation and concert producer in New York. He went on to coin the term “rock and roll” and was on top of the world.', 'Two characters played in broad strokes by Joe Pantoliano helped get Freed there. Leo Mintz owned a record shop where Black and white teenagers hung out together. Morris Levy, who ran a record company and owned Birdland Jazz Club, helped Freed break into producing concerts. Levy’s reputed mob ties meant his assistance came with strings.', 'Freed dodged various setbacks along the way but crashed following an investigation led by Hoover. He was accused of taking money to play records as well as claiming songwriting credits on tunes he didn’t author. Freed sank into obscurity and the bottle.', 'Over the show’s 2-plus hours, the design team’s work evokes a fitting period vibe. Director Randal Myler’s staging could never be accused of being subtle. When Hoover removes his shirt to reveal women’s lingerie underneath, it’s a little cheesy.', 'Following his death in 1965 at age 43, Freed was ultimately inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.

Kirsten is a teetotaler. “I never have,” she says. “I don’t like the taste.” He asks, “What do you like?” Her answer – chocolate – changes both their lives.', 'He serves her a Brandy Alexander, a dessert cocktail that goes down sweet and easy.

Subtly and naturally, they gradually lose their inhibitions and melt into each other. It evokes the age-old cliche, ""the rest of the world faded away,"" a feeling that extends to the audience thanks to Reza Behjat\'s hypnotic lighting. Soon enough, they\'re married and living in a Washington Heights apartment, hoping to have a child, hoping to advance their careers, hoping, unspoken, to change each other.', ""Lots more familiar tropes pop up throughout Del Carmen's script: judgmental in-laws, the impending move-in of an ailing mother, the shadow of class differences (Johaira is a lawyer from a higher-class background; Manuel is a working-class owner of a mechanic shop) lurking beneath their arguments. They don't read so much as tropes, though, as much as painfully common obstacles of marriage. Whether Manuel and Johaira can surmount them, once the novelty of each other has worn off and they can't skate by on carefree romance, is the question."", ""Of course, that setup as a whole is familiar. What sets Del Carmen's script apart, even as its scenes are structurally repetitve at times, is that she shows a couple actively trying, or at least trying to try, to work on themselves. I one scene, for example, Manuel interrupts Johaira as she rehearses a court statement; in a later one, he watches her proudly from the doorframe, waiting until she's finished. Making bigger changes is a bit harder — Johaira doesn't like to compromise, Manuel resists therapy, and both throw themselves into their jobs at the expense of each other — but the small moments of triumph make you want to root for them."", ""That's also a testament to the actors, both perfectly cast as the opposites-attract (another classic trope) pair. Xavier Pacheco endears as the cheeky Manuel, whose lack of interest in academia belies a deep sensitivity and emotional intuition. He is fiercely loyal, especially to his family, and commits 100% to all he does, and Pacheco never holds back from playing him to the fullest degree of all his feelings."", 'Opposite him, Maribel Martinez is captivating as the savvy, booksmart Johaira, who undergoes a truly heartbreaking 180 when unforeseen tragedy strikes.

It’s potentially provocative, but it’s used so much here the impact is diluted. The device takes you out of the play and into a guessing game.', 'Similarly, Icke juggles so many hot-topic themes – abortion, Alzheimer’s, anti-Semitism, and that’s just the A’s –  the play gets diffuse. At its best, ', 'The Doctor', ', which is based on a 1912 play by Arthur Schnitzler, raises a straightforward, chilling point: One decision can alter the entire trajectory of a carefully constructed life.', 'That’s what happens to Wolff – “double-f,” she notes, to separate herself from the beast –  the celebrated founding director of the Elizabeth Institute, which is bent on beating Alzheimer’s. In glimpses of her home life, we see how Wolff relates to that on a personal level. Her colleagues refer to her as BB, as in Big Bad. That nickname actually fits.

It’s a public relations catastrophe for the institute, which is looking to expand. Wolff and her career come under intense fire. Some colleagues support her, while others can’t defend her actions because of their faith, ethics, or aspirations to take over the institute.', 'The play is like an inverted onion – layers pile on.

Panelists take on Wolff about race, religion, faith versus medicine, abortion, the right to choose, and more.

'Wet Brain' review – an otherworldly look at generational trauma,"Read our four-star review of John J. Caswell, Jr.'s "", 'Wet Brain', ', a genre-bending play co-produced by Playwrights Horizons and MCC Theater, on through June 25.', 'John J. Caswell, Jr.’s ', 'Wet Brain', ' is a kitchen sink drama with a running faucet. The play grapples with addiction and loss, and it builds and builds like water pressure. Set in Arizona, three wayward siblings converge in the family home to care for their ailing, alcoholic father. There is a steady stream of troubles for the family, all afflicted by addiction, and the leak cannot be fixed. Or, perhaps, no one is up for the challenge.', 'Wet Brain', ', co-produced by ', 'Playwrights Horizons', ' and MCC Theater, offers a gripping, grating look at alcoholism and its effects on loved ones. The family patriarch, Joe (played with precision by Julio Monge), suffers from “wet brain,” a cognitive impairment caused by alcohol abuse. Joe is non-verbal, staggers across the stage, and experiences a distorted reality — he is often in another world, one possibly inhabited with extraterrestrials.', 'His daughter Angelina (Ceci Fernández) takes up the mantle of caring for him, but as an overworked nursing student, she enlists her brothers to help monitor their father. Joe is so far gone that his adult kids keep water bottles filled with vodka around the unkempt house to keep him at status quo and take turns keeping watch so he does not inflict self-harm. This environment is triggering for Ricky (Arturo Luís Soria), the estranged brother who left home to earn an M.B.A. and returns after six years.', 'The eldest brother, Ron (Frankie J. Alvarez), is perhaps the most affected by his father’s looming loss. His attempt to comfort his dad is to come over every morning and help him get ready for the day, pretending the pair will head off to work at the family’s auto mechanic garage. Joe, of course, is unable to work and stays home, hobbling around the house and drinking.', 'The play is supremely depressing, but there are moments of lightness, humor, and wonder that surprise. The comedy comes from the trio of siblings who probe wounds, poke fun, and recall childhood memories, all with humor, in the way only close siblings can do.', 'The three characters also hold a mirror up to one another, reflecting their myriad issues of alcohol and drug abuse, disordered eating, and mental illness. Ron tries to hide his dependence on alcohol by storing six packs in the toilet tank — his siblings are not so easily duped. These are all blows of a traumatic childhood. Besides their father’s illness, their mother died of suicide on Christmas Eve when the kids were young. There’s an unshakable, painful bond between the siblings, and the actors excavate the love beneath the surface through their tender performances.', ""Director Dustin Wills deftly navigates the genre-bending play as it moves between comedy, tragedy, and horror. Yes, horror. Through its immersive design, audiences are stuck in the family's discomfort, watching on like looky-loos peeping at a highway crash."", 'The set (by scenic designer Kate Noll) features a disheveled house with a large tree emerging from behind the roof, a sign of life outside the walls. The house, with its rocky foundation, spins from side to side between scenic transitions as eerie music (by co-sound designers Tei Blow and John Gasper) and flashing lights (by Cha See) transport the audience somewhere else entirely, perhaps inside Joe’s hallucinatory brain.', 'In the play’s most inventive, moving scene, the family ventures to a liminal plane that might be outer space. Projections (by Nick Hussong) of stars and planets whiz by as the family hangs on to an upside-down family room. They engage in painful, emotional conversations about the family’s trauma, and in this arena, Joe speaks fluidly and confidently. The scene evokes childlike wonder.', 'The play lacks a clear takeaway; rather, it offers up an examination of love and loss. Audiences go on a wild, wandering journey that casts addiction in a raw light. In Caswell Jr.’s play, the characters do not project judgment or disdain on their father or one another for their issues. They probe the truth of how mental illness and addiction trickled into their generation, and, by the end, they look for a way to fix the leaky faucet.', 'Wet Brain is at Playwrights Horizons through June 25.

He is almost as tall as the church in Cranberry, the Rochester suburb where the play takes place. His head towers over the top of Wally’s, the tiki bar restaurant where he spends almost all his free time drinking copious mai tais. The door to the Primary Trust Bank, where he works, is fit for a mouse, not a man.', 'As Kenneth invites us into his mind, scenic designer Marsha Ginsberg invites us into this dollhouse-like, Mister Rogers-inspired world, where time stands still and circles around and sometimes rushes forward out of Kenneth’s control.', 'Harper is on stage for the entirety of Eboni Booth’s carefully constructed play at ', 'Roundabout Theatre Company', "", a task that may be daunting for a less adept actor. If Harper seems tired by the end, it’s because Kenneth is tired: tired of explaining himself to others, who he assumes can’t understand him; tired of chasing after his lost friend, Bert (Eric Berryman), the only person he knows will accept him; tired of feeling like an outsider in the majority-white place he's lived his whole life that doesn't know what to do with him, a seemingly neurodivergent man whose mother died when has a child. Though the play is a tight 95 minutes, it leaves the impression that we can only leave when Kenneth finds rest."", 'Buoyed by a broader discussion of who society leaves behind and at the margins, ', 'Primary Trust', ' is an intimate character piece handled with tenderness by director Knud Adams. Throughout, a musical accompanist (Luke Wygodny) slams a call bell to trigger jumps in time. Kenneth, anxious and eager to please, seizes these small do-overs, as if in a Suzuki acting exercise, then shrinks as he muddles his thoughts again and again. He can only say what he means when he’s talking to Bert or addressing the audience; the device only feels tired when Kenneth neatly explains the mystery of  Bert’s presence in his life.', 'Dressed a little like the ', 'Sesame Street', ' character (in costumes by Qween Jean), the imaginary Bert is one clue that something in this world is off. Kenneth fears others will see him talking to Bert in public, but Corrina (April Matthis), a waitress at Wally’s who befriends him, implies their conversations are not had aloud. “You never talk to anybody,” she says of Kenneth’s time at the restaurant. “I’m the first person you’ve had a full conversation with.” Something in Cranberry is not quite real, even as the performances and relationships among the characters feel grounded.', 'The most gratifying element of ', 'Primary Trust', ' is its ending, which at first hints at the tidy closure of stories, as if the characters are dolls about to be put back in their boxes. Kenneth earns a predictable achievement at work, says he might go finish his college degree, and begins to socialize with his colleagues instead of spending evenings alone.', 'But life is not picture-perfect like Ginsberg’s model town. “Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, screaming, scared that I’ve done something wrong,” Kenneth confesses. The turn isn’t macabre but realistic, a reminder that Kenneth’s journey isn’t over. It is only right now.', 'Primary Trust', ' is at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theatre through July 2.

That\'s sort of by design.

But here\'s the gist: Kingsman wrote a show called ', 'Wildfowl', "", about an unnamed, quirky, sexual, troubled woman aimlessly navigating her late 20s, and it's getting filmed in the hopes a British producer will turn it into a smash hit TV show."", 'That setup may sound familiar, and it should — ', 'One Woman Show', ' is a thinly veiled spoof on ', 'Fleabag', ', the 2016 vehicle by Phoebe Waller-Bridge that spawned a surge in the ""messy woman"" genre of black comedy, in which traumatic memories, meaningless sex, and general unlikability take center stage in the name of ""relatability."" Kingsman doesn\'t hold back in her critique of the genre: As Dana, the put-together boss within ', 'Wildfowl', ', Kingsman drops the particularly pointed line, ""You\'re not a mess, you just want to be seen as one.""', ""But Kingsman's show is first and foremost a comedy act itself, and it goes in its own zany, original direction. "", 'One Woman Show', ' features plenty of tongue-in-cheek jabs at tired tropes (""I\'m having a remember,"" she says as Daniel Carter-Brennan\'s lighting signals the start of a flashback), but it also includes interpretive dancing and an unexpectedly hilarious subplot about tall drink of water (he\'s 8\' 9"", Kingsman states) named Phil, who she first sees on the subway. Phil\'s subsequent arrival in her office plants the seeds for a whirlwind fling to bloom in the absence of her aloof boyfriend, Jared.', 'If ', 'One Woman Show', ' simply skewered the ', 'Fleabag', ' genre for trying too hard to be ""edgy,"" ""vulnerable,"" and ""different,"" it would run the risk of falling into that exact same trap. But Kingsman is too smart for that. She\'s acutely aware of how closely she\'s following ', 'Fleabag', ""'s playbook, down to the striped shirt and overalls that mimic one of Waller-Bridge's onscreen outfits. More significantly, Kingsman's and Waller-Bridge's creations are both brilliant, bitter solo acts whose explosive success propelled them to the international stage."", ""So Kingsman winkingly embraces that, piling meta layer upon meta layer into the show's 70 minutes. Just as her "", 'Wildfowl', ' character stumbles her way through her life and career, Kingsman herself ""stumbles"" her way through the show\'s taping, as the seemingly disinterested stage crew repeatedly informs her that the cameras or mic aren\'t working and, essentially, they just have to get this over with — much to Kingsman\'s chagrin.', ""It's clear when Kingsman is performing as her "", 'Wildfowl', "" character, but who she's performing as in between — her own self, or else a heightened, characterized version that may as well be its own alter ego — isn't as black-and-white."", ""Whoever that persona is, she acknowledges that the root target of her satire isn't "", 'Fleabag', ' or its successors at all. It\'s a culture that selectively invests in women, puts them into boxes — likable vs. unlikable, prudish vs. sexual, vulnerable vs. unrelatable, admirable vs. messy — and has made the ""messy woman"" into the latest box that they can acceptably occupy.', 'Kingsman admits that her show (again, whether she means ', 'Wildfowl', ' or ', 'One Woman Show', ' is deliberately vague, as it\'s likely both) ""came from bitterness and envy"" at other women\'s ability to be successful despite their flaws, put-on or not.

Of course, you can’t repeat the past — or, so Nick Carraway insists in ', 'The Great Gatsby', '. “Of course you can,” Gatsby counters.', 'Turns out Gatsby’s right. At the Park Central Hotel, where ', 'The Great Gatsby - The Immersive Show', ' has landed stateside after a record-breaking U.K. run, the alluring, pulsing glamour of the ‘20s is alive in full glory.', 'Production company Immersive Everywhere has transformed a wing of the hotel into the Gatsby Mansion, where we, the audience, are guests at one of Gatsby’s legendary parties. So are all the characters from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel, and among them — and us — the classic story unfolds.', 'It doesn’t do so in the same linear fashion of the book, of course. We do begin in the same way, with Nick Carraway as narrator, introducing us to the fated title billionaire and his longtime love for the beautiful (and married) socialite Daisy Buchanan. After the opening scene in the main ballroom, which ends in a full-company (and audience-encouraged) Charleston dance, the party breaks up and different groups follow various characters into other rooms.', 'Unlike at a show like ', 'Sleep No More', "" (arguably NYC's best-known immersive offering), where audiences are left to explore the venues and follow characters as they choose, "", 'Gatsby', "" is more structured: You'll change locations when and where a character corrals you and others standing nearby. This setup makes "", 'Gatsby', ' perfect for first-time immersive theatregoers, who might not otherwise know where to go or what to do. The downside is that you might not get to spend much time with the characters most interesting to you.', ""Regardless of where you go, you won't experience every room or scene in one go, making "", 'Gatsby', "" ripe for repeat attendance. I, for one, spent most of the first act with Nick, Tom Buchanan (Daisy's pompous, cheating husband), and Myrtle Wilson (Tom's social-climbing mistress) in Tom's quarters, partaking in a loose recreation of the book's scene where he hits Myrtle for flippantly discussing Daisy."", 'I later detoured to the gambling table of the corrupt Meyer Wolfsheim (a minor character in the novel, who here gets upgraded to a principal role complete with a multi-instrument-and-tap-dance number at the top of Act 2), where we guests aided him and parlor performer Kitty in writing a love song for Daisy.', 'It is worth noting here that ', 'Gatsby', "" is truly both immersive and interactive — you're not just in the world, watching the characters around you, but they're actively engaging with you throughout. Besides dancing with them during the aforementioned Charleston (the first of multiple dance breaks), you might supply Nick with a pickup line to use on sophisticated golfer Jordan Baker, take a photo with Jordan (as I did), or be enlisted by Gatsby himself as his personal assistant while he fretfully prepares to host Daisy for tea (as my +1 did)."", 'As such, guests are encouraged to dress to theme (or at least dress up), and you run the risk of Gatsby remarking on it if you don\'t: ""Most of you are dressed impeccably,"" he observes as he\'s perfecting his tea setup, then quips: ""Please stand in front of someone who is not.""', ""The small-group breakouts are less directly plucked from Fitzgerald's plot and more inspired by his world, and they make "", 'Gatsby', "" stand out in the sense that they go beyond the novel and create a unique experience of the story. But stay in and around the ballroom if you want to watch the novel's key scenes play out."", ""You'll only get the broad strokes of the plot no matter what, but such is the nature of this kind of adaptation. (Not every "", 'Gatsby', ' theatrical work can be ', 'Gatz', "", a 6-8-hour long staging of Fitzgerald's unabridged text.) That's not to say director Alexander Wright's adapted text is entirely banal — for example, the placement of Daisy and Gatsby's first tryst and Myrtle's fight with her desperate, possessive husband, George, illuminated a parallel between the two women I'd never considered in my many previous encounters with the story. Both women are caught between a loveless marriage and a troubled affair, and neither option will bring her real happiness."", ""The elusiveness of love and of the American Dream are the novel's most prescient, somber themes, and all the characters ultimately feel them. Those themes are still baked into this "", 'Gatsby', ', but the true draw is the party, to get swept up in a bygone era at its most lavish, liquored, and loose-limbed.', 'Does that mean this ', 'Gatsby', "" entirely honors its source material? Perhaps not. But in the novel, Gatsby's countless houseguests are only interested in him when a party's going on, barely caring when he dies. Here, Gatsby's death happens with little fanfare, and shortly afterwards, the show ends and the audience is invited to stay and drink and dance the night away. Noting that parallel shouldn't spoil your enjoyment of this truly vivacious show, but it is a reminder that, again, we can repeat the past.

When that trip is 36 hours long, it’s impossible not to imagine both. Such is the conceit of Keith Bunin’s ', 'The Coast Starlight', ', now playing at ', 'Lincoln Center Theater', '.', ""The play begins with Jane (Camila Canó-Flaviá) and T.J. (Will Harrison) confessing, or rehearsing, what they would have told each other on the title train if either had gathered the courage to speak. Though they don't know it, they were both taken with each other almost instantly, as if drawn together by some external force of fate (or narrative convenience)."", 'Jane is a cartoonist en route to Seattle to visit, and probably break up with, her long-distance boyfriend. T.J., a Navy combat medic, was set to ship out from San Diego to Afghanistan the next morning but instead bought a train ticket with a stolen credit card. Noah (Rhys Coiro), a world-weary veteran, interrupts the would-be lovers with his own reverie of what he might have said to the shaken T.J.', 'T.J.’s conflict could be engaging should the play’s proverbial train ever leave the station, and Coiro lends a hard-edged sense of humor to Noah that endears him to the audience. However, ', 'The Coast Starlight', ' chugs along at a snail’s pace. Actors shout monotonous recollections and delight in their half-hearted observations on the human condition along the entire Pacific Coast, leaving little unexpressed and more to be desired.', ""Fortunately, Liz (Mia Barron) soon bursts onto the train, reeling from a breakup at a wellness retreat that may have almost been the scene of her murder. She screeches the story of her failed relationship into her phone as the other passengers worry she doesn’t realize they're there. Barron knows how to work the audience for laughs in between moments of tension, and her performance delights and entertains the rest of the journey."", 'The Coast Starlight', ""’s thesis — that strangers on a train could change each other’s lives, and that you never really know what someone else is going through — wants to be profound, but it lands somewhere a bit juvenile. Life lessons such as these feel obvious, and the characters’s exchanges on empathy don't feel like natural dialogue."", 'It doesn’t help that Jane has one of the biggest parts but the lowest stakes of the passengers. Her love life feels out of place with discussions of Noah’s transience or Anna (Michelle Wilson, whose performance exudes love) identifying her deceased brother’s body.', 'Lighting by Lap Chi Chu expertly evokes sunlight peeking through window slats, but other scenic elements do nothing to accelerate or enhance the story; the turntable stage spins so often and so much at a time as to render its potential meaning null. Director Tyne Rafaeli can pull much more resonant stage images from a text, but here, her touch feels missing.', 'The play works best when it relies less on the literal thoughts of the passengers and leans into the purgatorial nature of the train: T.J. is trapped in a space that can only function as liminal, set to leave a career meant to be temporary as well. When his life plays out before his eyes, when his future contains all the possibilities and disappointments a train ride can hold — that is when the play soars.

Prudencia is an expert on the oral transmission of Scottish ballads and studies the topic of hell in traditional folk music. Even the lofty linguistic experts attending the conference find that strange, particularly her archenemy, Dr. Colin Smye (Ewan Black). He’s an expert on football chants.', 'The snowbound attendees retreat to a pub for a raucous evening of karaoke and debauchery — Prudencia’s personal hell. She’d rather hide out at a nearby bed and breakfast. The rowdy karaoke singers warn Prudencia not to wander outside alone, because on the evening of a solstitial full moon, the devil lurks in the dark to collect souls. What happens next might be a hypothermic or liquor-induced nightmare.', 'Director Wils Wilson, who co-created the show with David Greig, leads with imagination. The cast employs physical theatre tricks. In one scene, Prudencia sits on the bar, and castmates form a makeshift car around her, a violin bow serving as a windshield wiper as she drives. In another, an audience member’s arms become the handles of Colin’s motorcycle, while a cast member ruffles his scarf behind him in the wind. Janice Parker’s movement direction is all-encompassing, and the troupe dances on tabletops and snakes between the crowd throughout the show, sometimes pulling the audience into the action.', 'This inventiveness extends to the music. The cast of five play Scottish folk music and produce various sound effects with spoons, kazoos, glass bottles, and even a crinkly bag of potato chips held in front of a microphone to imitate the sound of a 1700s phonograph. The show’s musical playfulness (led by music director Alasdair Macrae) balances its spooky, supernatural themes.', 'The Club Car, transformed into a lively Scottish pub, is a character in and of itself. The most impressive element of the immersive design, by Georgia McGuinness, is the lighting. Rows of orb lights glow like full moons. The pendant lights change color; pink when Prudencia is seemingly in control, red when the devil is, and multicolor when no one is. (The lights flash rainbow colors during the karaoke bit.) In one scene, the space goes pitch black, and cast members spotlight each other with torch lights to eerie effect. In another, candles on the cocktail tables are the sole source of light.', 'Prudencia’s undoing is both literal and figurative. Throughout the show, her crown braids unfurl, her pussy-bow blouse unravels, and her prudent disposition unknots. Boyd graciously leads the character through this transition with a robust voice and steadfastness.', 'The multi-talented ensemble takes on roles of academics, revelers, and hellish tempters. All are superb. Gavin Jon Wright makes for a steely devil, Ewan Black brings the laughs, and Natali McCleary steals the spotlight as a ghostly figure singing the folk tune “Blackwaterside.” Throughout the show, musician Charlie West impressively plays a host of instruments, including the fiddle.', 'Like good bartenders, or gracious bed and breakfast hosts, the cast and crew of ', 'The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart', ' offer the audience ham and gruyère sandwiches at intermission.

I’m going to be a star!” The busy throng of shopkeepers, residents, and trade workers bristle at his unbridled enthusiasm.', 'Ivan finds work at a congregation, where he falls for Elsa (Meecah), the ward and love interest of the preacher (J.

He records a song with the powerful music producer Mr. Hilton but refuses to sign the low contract he offers. Ivan wants to do things his way. Unbeknownst to Elsa, Ivan begins working in the “fishing business” — the ganja trade — to earn a living and support his musical career.', 'The music industry and the ganja industry, it turns out, are inextricably linked. Ivan rocks the boat wherever he goes, and instead of making a music record, he winds up mounting a criminal record. ""Around here, it takes more than talent to get a fair shake,"" he laments. ""People trying to keep me down everywhere I turn!""', 'Directors Tony Taccone and Sergio Trujillo lead with airtight precision. The musical moves quickly, and the propulsive energy is in constant motion. One of the most inventive scenes is set at The Rialto, a cinema where Ivan and some acquaintances watch a Western film. A white sheet becomes the film screen, and spinning velvet sets become a barrier as the moviegoers engage in a rousing game of cowboys and Native Americans while singing “Hero Don’t Never Die.” (It’s a bit of foreshadowing for Ivan’s hero journey.)', 'Another strong (and quick) scene begins with the congregation singing the hymnal “Closer Walk With Thee.” The prayer swiftly turns into a dance-hall fantasy, and as Elsa averts her attention from Jesus to Ivan, she strips off her choir robe to reveal a tight-fitting dress. Ivan and Elsa dance and gyrate on a club platform (choreography is by Edgar Godineaux), and the surrounding choir members disrobe and rapidly dress again to finish the hymn. The preacher remains in place, unmoored.', 'Jones is one of many strong performers. Upon meeting Elsa, Ivan declares, “You sing like a bird, you know.” Indeed, Meecah and her beautiful voice shine in this role. Like Ivan, Elsa is a big dreamer, and she charms and inspires. Another standout performance is Jacob Ming-Trent as Pedro, Ivan’s loyal best friend who helps him settle in Kingston. Pedro takes center stage for his big number, “The Ballad of Ivan,” driving support for Ivan as his friend runs from the police.', 'The cost of fame is very high. Ivan’s nickname morphs from “country boy” to “pretty boy” to “the outlaw” in just a short while.

He performs a series of monologues that all involve, to some extent, drug and alcohol use: He plays a talent agent dependent on cocaine to deal with Hollywood hotheads, a drunk man on the street with delusions of grandeur, a stony preacher who encourages his audience to “take a bottle, fill it up with gasoline, light it on fire, throw it into one of these abortion clinics.”', 'Royo, who has been ', 'sober for over a year', ', begins the show with a brief introduction to his adolescence in the Bronx (and was surprised that, at my performance, no one clapped at the borough’s mention). With the house lights still up, Royo’s transition into his first character is seamless, but further ones are more muddled.', 'Audiences unfamiliar with Bogosian’s solo plays may strive to make connections among the characters, some of whom may be one man’s alter ego or a voice in another’s head. They are connected most of all not by Mark Armstrong’s direction or Royo’s performance, but by Kristen Robinson’s carceral set, which evokes an apartment complex, a recording studio, and an asylum all at once in its stark simplicity.', 'The script, revised for this revival (Bogosian first performed the show in 1986), references culture war arguments still raging as much today as when Bogosian won the Drama Desk Award.

Despite the heavy topics, Julia Izumi’s farcical tragedy ', 'Regretfully, So the Birds Are', ' is a joyful romp.', 'The playful world premiere — co-produced by ', 'Playwrights Horizons', ' and ', 'WP Theater', ' — is neatly structured into three acts that follow the three siblings as they renege on their three sibling pacts.', 'Illy’s solution to navigating her quarter-life crisis is to buy a piece of the sky. Mora sets off to find her birth mother, and feeble-minded Neel heads to Nebraska to listen to country music (he intended to go to Nashville).', ""The siblings' performances are the production’s biggest strength. Mora, played by Shannon Tyo, is the self-proclaimed “disaster older sister.” Tyo brings physical comedy to the role, and she spirals while clinging to her status as the favorite child. As Illy, Sasha Diamond dons a tweed lady jacket and a pussy bow blouse (costumes are by Alicia J. Austin) and plays the most buttoned-up sibling with verve."", 'Sky Smith shines as the feeble-minded Neel, whose sense of self changes when he discovers he is tone-deaf. The trio flails while their mom, Elinore (played with hilarity by Kristine Nielsen), gets high in jail.', 'Under the well-paced direction of Jenny Koons, the humor lands. Many scenes involve Gibson Frazier as Cam the Snowman, who enters the stage in a flurry of snowflakes and appears in a snowman cutout while doling out advice and fun facts. Frazier also portrays Cowman, a heroic rancher sporting not just one but two cowboy hats. A flock of colorful birds, puppeteered by the whole cast, also draws laughs.', 'The production design ups the farce with a cartoonish sky above a treehouse, a half-burned living room, and the snowman (scenic design is by You-Shin Chen). A recurring joke comes in the form of a glaring spotlight (lighting is by Stacey Derosier) each time one of the siblings yells, “Attention!”', 'The second act loses a bit of steam and gets increasingly improbable when Mora travels to Cambodia, but the 90-minute show remains highly entertaining.', 'The play does not offer the Whistler siblings, or the audience, a playbook for adulting, nor does it come down hard against adoption, as one might expect. Audiences who enjoyed ', 'MCC Theater’s ', 'Wolf Play', ' will enjoy ', 'Regretfully, So the Birds Are', ', as both creatively examine the complexities of adoptive identity.

Jackson that spoofs and celebrates soap operas.', 'White Girl in Danger', ' is Michael R. Jackson’s latest musical foray. The story-within-a-story takes place in Allwhite, a fictional universe infused with soap opera tropes and flairs for the melodramatic. Here, Keesha is a “Blackground” actor stuck in a loop of slave narratives and stories of police brutality. But when Keesha gets promoted to the Allwhite Best Friend character, she sees a pathway to landing a central storyline.', 'At the Allwhite high school, Keesha plays bestie to Megan, Maegan, and Meagan, a trio of white girls with myriad issues. Megan (Molly Hager) has a drinking problem, Maegen (Alyse Alan Louis) struggles with an eating disorder, and Meagan (Lauren Marcus) is a klutz with an abusive boyfriend (Eric William Morris). Keesha is the foil to their chaos. The Megans just want their band, Girlwhite, to take home the top prize at the upcoming Battle of the Bands, but Keesha is creeping in on their turf. Oh, and there’s a killer on the loose.', 'Like Jackson’s Tony Award-winning ', 'A Strange Loop', ', ', 'White Girl in Danger', ' is highly referential. It nods to soap operas, musicals, satires, thrillers, and even fantasy novels. It’s chock-full of Easter eggs for pop culture enthusiasts. It’s hard to catch them all, especially the ones stuffed into fast-paced songs. Under the direction of Lileana Blain-Cruz, the musical catapults through time and space swiftly.', 'The design helps to transport the audience through the wild ride of genres. The Allwhite high school is reminiscent of the ‘80s sitcom ', 'Saved By the Bell', ', with a Memphis-style design of zigzag walls and bright lockers by scenic designer Adam Rigg. At the annual “Anti-Allwhite Diamond charity fashion show for Blackground Representation Matters,” the actors don glittery gowns with shoulder pads (by costume designer Montana Levi Blanco), a nod to the long-running soap ', 'Dynasty', '. The raucous number “Let’s Party” mirrors house parties in ‘90s flicks, complete with pulsing lights (by Jen Schriever), grunge attire, and red Solo cups.', 'The ride of this three-hour musical is too long, especially considering Keesha reaches her outlined objectives by the end of Act 1. But she wants more — she wants to dismantle Allwhite supremacy and lift the Blackgrounds from oppression. The second act cascades into several more genres and hits hot-button issues, one after another. There is a big payoff, though, that brings the rambling story to a close. (It’s too bad some audience members in my row left at intermission and missed it.)', 'The performances are certainly worth sticking around for. As Keesha, Latoya Edwards is exacting and steadfast in achieving the character’s motives, whether she’s portraying a runaway enslaved person, a self-assured lawyer, or a seductive lesbian. As the storylines shift, Edwards seamlessly transitions and brings the audience along for the ride, full throttle.', 'Tarra Conner Jones delivers a standout performance as Nell Gibbs, Keesha’s mother who sacrifices her own plot to center her daughter’s. Throughout the musical, Nell takes on various roles in the Allwhite universe, from school lunch lady to nurse to the assistant district attorney to mammy. Her powerful pipes soar in several songs, particularly the 11 o’clock number “Why I Kill.” Jones elicits audience laughter with her physical comedy, even simple sidelong glances. Best of all, she fully embodies the character of a mother with a deep well of unconditional love, despite her daughter’s antics. As Keesha puts it: “You are the greatest Mom character of all time.”', 'Fans of ', 'A Strange Loop', ' will enjoy this jaunt through Jackson’s imagination.

The play’s two characters argue in jest about which player leaves a bigger mark: Jordan did this, but James did that, and in this amount of time.', 'Their arguments, at least when it comes to basketball and its stars, are inconsequential, held for argument’s sake and not imparting much meaning on their characters’ journeys. Unfortunately, none of their other conversations — about jobs and money, about dreams and ambition, about social norms and expectations — impart much meaning either.', 'King James', ' follows Matt (', 'Chris Perfetti', "") and Shawn (Glenn Davis), two strangers who become close friends after Matt sells Shawn his Cleveland Cavaliers season tickets in 2004, James's rookie season.

None of the details about the game, the Cavs, or James’s career require more than a cursory Wikipedia study to learn and integrate into the play. There is little discussion of James as a person or the brand he has built, and it feels as though any athlete or figure could be substituted in Matt and Shawn’s dialogue. During the first act, I considered that ', 'King James', ' may play better in Cleveland, but this thought demeans Cleveland audiences, who might find use of their city, their team, their star more superficial.', 'Joseph tries to use James as a vehicle to discuss race in America in a paint-by-numbers fight between the two characters, then drops the passion to force the men to make up by show’s end. It makes sense for a white man and a Black man in a friendship to discuss racist microaggressions — Matt loves Shawn, but Shawn knows Matt must reckon with his ingrained biases — but the attempt is too transparent to land. If Shawn truly believes Matt has shown his true self through these microaggressions, why does he then decide their love of basketball is more important? After 12 years, could he really not find another friend to watch basketball with who wouldn’t belittle him?', ""Joseph, a former Pulitzer Prize finalist, also offers a nonsensical depiction of a writer's life: In 2014, Shawn is $100,000 in debt and must ask Matt to buy his plane ticket so he can take a meeting in Los Angeles.

The 75-minute show, the latest stage production from Audible Theater, provides a lesson on how to navigate grief and offer support beyond platitudes.

In this bit, Kayne introduces himself to the audience and shares how he went from studying musical theatre at New York University to finding success as a comedian."", 'As a nod to Kayne’s background as a math and English tutor, the rest of the show takes the shape of an engaging lesson plan. Kayne uses two rolling whiteboards and a lectern to deliver lessons on phonetics, quantum physics, and history that all tie into the universal experience of bereavement. “Grief was not always so isolated,” he shares before diving into a lesson on how science increased lifespans and impacted the collective experience of loss.', 'The show is a meditation on existentialism — and it is painfully sad. Kayne carefully shepherds the audience into the heavy material and provides beats of silence for processing. After he shares what he says is the worst sentence in the world, “My son is dead,” he offers an opportunity for audience members to exit the theatre if they so choose.', 'Despite the topic, the charismatic Kayne finds moments of levity to lift the energy. He artfully inserts buttons of humor after intense stories. After recalling the process of planning his son’s funeral, he breaks into laughter when describing the funeral receipt that read “Thank you come again.”', 'Like other Audible Theater shows, the stage design is minimal since the performance will live on in audio form, but it’s impactful.

Like in ', 'Seinfeld', ', decades later, Sidney’s door never seems to be locked, enabling others to enter and exit freely for drama’s sake.', 'Sidney is an idealist and an intellectual, prone to quoting great writers and, oddly, using affectations like “my boy” when talking to David (Glenn Fitzgerald), a gay playwright and upstairs neighbor. Iris is a wannabe actress who waits tables and has saved her tip money to see a shrink. She’s had plenty to discuss during two years of psychoanalysis, including that the story she’s told her husband about her Oklahoma upbringing is largely fiction. Her finest acting gig: Mrs. Brustein.', 'Five years into the marriage, cracks are showing. That Sidney sneers at Iris’s acting skills and derides her plans to do a TV commercial doesn’t help. Nor does the fact Sidney is a dreamer who does what he wants when he wants it.', 'Immediately after the failure of his last enterprise — “a place just to listen to good folk records” — he has somehow bought the Village Crier. “My little artsy-craftsy newspaper is going to stay out of politics,” he says.', 'Sidney admits he’s done trying to save the world, a retreat from human affairs a friend slyly calls “ostrich-cism.” But there’s an election going on, and Alton (Julian De Niro), a friend who’s involved with Iris’s sister Gloria (Gus Birney), a fashion model, so she claims, persuades Sidney to support the reform candidate Wally O’Hara (Andy Grotelueschen).', 'Sidney reluctantly agrees and then goes even further. He hangs a campaign poster boosting Wally in his apartment window. For Sidney, Wally’s fate – and his role in securing it –  is brutal when he wakes up to the politician’s true colors. By this time, the Brustein marriage looks like a goner.', 'Clocking in at 3 hours, which includes an intermission, Hansberry’s play has plenty of sweep – maybe too much. It takes on racism, anti-Semitism, political corruption, suicide, homosexuality, and social activism. Performances are all over the map. At one point, three characters inexplicably sit below the elevated set to watch what’s happening.', 'Isaac (', 'Star Wars', ') goes big in his star turn.

Her parents — friendly-to-a-fault Lou (Frank Wood) and high-strung Peg (Constance Shulman) — are reluctant retirees in New Jersey. ""It might be kind of a waste, but it\'s something to do"" is their unofficial motto, as both would rather work but can\'t seem to hack it anymore.', ""They can't even live vicariously through their daughter, who doesn't live up to their definition of success.

The road trip, Peg insists, will make for a refreshing switch from both their listless lives."", ""The expected U.S. landmark-gawking, father-daughter bonding, and well-meaning parental nagging all happen. But the title forewarns us these interactions will build to a tragedy. An omniscient, emcee-like character known only as Maps (a commanding Maureen Sebastian) subtly amps up the foreboding tone, matter-of-factly dictating the characters' movements and actions as though only she can control their fates."", ""Lou and Ella learn a lot about each other on the road, and while some of their ensuing debates are benign (like Lou's insistence that college honor societies are more important than she thinks), others reveal larger, potentially insurmountable, gaps between who each thought the other was and who they actually are."", 'Two major revelations come out in ', 'The Best We Could', "" that fully upend the already strained family.

Feldman's play has vastly different subject matter ("", 'Downstate', "" centers on formerly imprisoned sex offenders), but it tackles similar themes.

And not figuratively.', 'Like a couple of saplings, the two have actually been dug into the earth – an effect achieved through a simple theatrical sleight as two small circular trap doors descend. They can’t move. After the initial shock, they’re not so bothered by that. “It’s weird, but I’m fine,” David, a filmmaker, tells his soon-to-be-ex boyfriend Jared (Sean Donovan). The brother and sister don’t seek help from anyone — not town officials, medical professionals, or tree surgeons.', 'So what’s next? Is it a show about accepting whatever life throws our way, no matter how bizarre? Is it the setup for an absurd existential outing? Is it a riff on ', 'Waiting for Godot', ', a meditation on finding one’s place or purpose in life, this time observed through the perspective of the tree mentioned in that play? Good questions.', '“Maybe we just needed to stop, you know?” says Sheila. “Maybe everything just needed to stop.” Maybe. But waiting for the play to branch into a coherent and compelling narrative proves to be an exercise in frustration. What emerges is a group portrait of odd-lot characters drawn to Sheila and David, or at least to what’s befallen them.', ""Among them is Baba, the sibs’ elderly Polish grandmother (Danusia Trevino). She comes prepared to keep them safe, including protecting them from wolves that prowl this neck of the woods. Baba sets up a tent and lights a campfire. She'll now live her life outside with her grandkids."", 'Meanwhile, obnoxiously self-obsessed Charlotte (Becky Yamamoto), Sheila’s longtime friend, presumably comes by to check on her pal. But Charlotte spends most of her time crabbing about caring for her mother before quickly leaving.', 'Saul (Max Gordon Moore), a rabbi with a small congregation in Cleveland, arrives convinced that what’s happened to the siblings is a miracle. “I thought it might be an intervention. In the world. A shift. In history.” In a strange twist, Saul uproots himself from Ohio. He and Sheila embark on a loving relationship and manage to raise a family together. It’s not going out on a limb to consider it a wild turn of events. Seems there’s someone out there for everyone.', 'Terry, a vendor who visits the park, initially seems inconsequential enough. He’s just hawking pretzels, chips, and bottled water. But Terry’s interest extends beyond snacks. He becomes the driving force for building a mall – with a food court and a Nordstrom – right where Sheila and David are planted.

Kene seamlessly transitions between playing himself and the “virus,” with a red knit beanie denoting the latter. He delivers the spoken word rhythmically with a clear, smooth East London accent.', 'Under Omar Elerian’s direction and Rachael Nanyonjo’s movement direction, Kene shines and redefines the solo show form. The performance is a physical, musical, and comedic feat involving running, jumping, and even simulated swimming. The show spotlights Kene, but he’s hardly alone on stage. The first-rate, integrated design envelops The Shed’s Griffin Theater and takes on a character of its own.', 'Video projections by Daniel Denton, lighting design by Jackie Shemesh, sound design by Elena Peña, and special effects by Jeremy Chernick all transform the set into a vibrant cityscape. There are a few scenes, though, where Kene’s spoken word drowns beneath the booming music and bright lights.', 'Rajha Shakiry’s sleek set is flanked by two musicians and the show’s co-music directors: Liam Godwin, an emphatic, head-banging pianist and conductor; and Nadine Lee, who impressively moves from the drums to the bass guitar throughout the show. The musicians also portray Kene’s friends Raymond and Donna, a couple unimpressed with Kene’s play within the play. Raymond says, “I mean, the whole ‘guy beats someone up on a night bus’ thing? It felt like another…” “Generic angry young Black man!” Donna interjects.', 'Kene’s character struggles to separate identity politics from his playmaking process. “I don’t even wanna write the enlightening play that ticks all the boxes and bridges the racial and sexual and LGBTQ+ abyss that some people expect of me. I just wanna write a play, man. A regular play. It’s really not that deep. Can a play from a person like me just be a fucking play already?”', 'The searing work grapples with cultural representation, gentrification, and the playful creation of art. ', 'Misty', "" does so with many metaphors, most having to do with balloons. A standout scene features Kene in a wetsuit getting pummeled by water balloons. A stagehand throws them as Kene’s sister (portrayed by Ifeoluwa Adeniyi, a teen with a commanding presence) stands downstage at a mic and hurls insults about his writing. Another powerful scene includes a giant orange balloon that Kene is trapped inside, his head floating above it. While calling Raymond and Donna to defend his play, he attempts to escape the bubble. It's an impressive display of comedic timing and physical strength. (Both these scenes also display Kene’s bare chest — his abs elicited a few impressed gasps from the audience.)"", 'Another scene includes a projection of a floating balloon, and another sees a cascade of orange balloons spill out of a giant box and dance along the footlights.

While Act 2 continues to follow both Kene’s story and the virus’s run from the “antiviral” police, it seems a bit, to continue with the balloon metaphor, inflated.', 'The play is open to interpretation, and there are some unanswered questions. The term “misty” might refer to the slang word for crack cocaine, or maybe it describes the nebulous, genre-bending plot or the smoggy smoke effects. Perhaps it refers to the misty-eyed Kene, taking a bow to conclude his tour de force performance. There are many ways to describe the show, and it reaches Kene’s objective: It doesn’t tick boxes of what a play about a Black man should look like, or what any play should look like, for that matter.

At the beginning of the play, (mostly) offstage performer Alejandra Ospina describes it in a clarion voice: “The set is a long shallow box raised 16 inches above the floor. Rectangular in shape and light pink. Very, very pink: Benjamin Moore’s Island Sunset Pink.” The platform is flanked with sequin-wrapped poles and topped with big, pillowy bubble letters that spell the show’s title. It’s a bright, stark contrast to the show’s content, which exposes the harsh reality of everyday experiences for disabled people.', 'The 75-minute autobiographical show, written by and starring Ryan J. Haddad, probes ableism and his experience as a gay man with cerebral palsy living in New York City. The co-production between the Bushwick Starr and ', 'The Public Theater', ' features vignettes of his stories of dating, working, and getting from place to place. The beachy set transforms the Public’s Shiva Theater space into a gay bar, a bus, a subway, an apartment, and even a barn.', 'Ospina’s audio descriptions are just one of the show’s integrated accessibility elements. Captions appear on the back wall of the set, and Dickie Hearts, a Deaf performer, transcribes the show in American Sign Language alongside Haddad. Each performance is relaxed, with dimmed house lights, and there’s an offstage movement space for patrons, complete with tactile samples of the plush letters on the set. And while the show is accessible to disabled people, its message targets non-disabled people.', ""“I try to make disability funny so that non-disabled people can understand it and open themselves to it... Not tonight. I don't feel like it,” Haddad explains at the outset. “I'm not saying I won't make you laugh at all. I'll probably make you laugh a lot. I'm a naturally comedic person. But not everything is accessible to us, so why should we try to make our experiences accessible to you?”"", 'Indeed, the writer-performer makes the audience laugh a lot. He has an endearing charisma, knock-your-socks-off confidence, and tip-top comedic timing. He’s open about his sexuality, and some of the funniest scenes begin with a declaration of feeling horny. Haddad shares his universal stories of first-date jitters, business-meeting nerves, and airport security anxieties. His cerebral palsy and use of a walker only heighten these experiences.', 'Haddad and Hearts don crewneck sweaters with “Ryan” embroidered on the front. But Hearts’s onstage role is threefold: he acts out scenes as Haddad in ASL, performs as himself in one portion, and takes on other characters, including bus drivers, nosy neighbors, and Grindr dates. Hearts is also an onstage companion, offering Haddad a hand to hold and a shoulder to lean on. In one scene, when Haddad talks about his glasses sliding off while using a public restroom, Hearts manually glides Haddad’s spectacles down his nose. He’s an ebullient and energetic presence.', 'Jordan Fein’s skillful direction balances the laughter with a well-paced dosing of the grim truth — New York City, like the world, is not built for disabled people. Media often represents the disabled experience as monolithic, but ', 'Dark Disabled Stories', ' includes a variety of lenses. In addition to Haddad, Hearts and Ospina share their life experiences.', ""In one scene, Haddad assumes the role of audio describing. Ospina takes center stage to talk about the challenges of navigating New York City’s public transportation with a power chair, recounting several times a lack of working subway elevators and unhelpful staff kept her trapped underground. Hearts contributes a story about the challenges of dating as a Deaf person:  “I want a partner; I want intimacy. Intimacy is rarely accessible to me because of the language barrier.

The scene is meticulously choreographed, but it doesn\'t feel like a performance. They\'re tapping into something bigger.', ""These girls are here, in a makeshift self-defense workshop, to learn to protect themselves from would-be assaulters — something a now-hospitalized peer couldn't do. Their rhythmic movements give way to more free-flowing jabs as they release aggression and force and pain, some of it previously unknown to them. Maybe they're not even learning to fight back in this moment. Maybe they're just learning to fight."", ""They each have their reasons to, beyond avoiding their classmate's fate. Outspoken Diana (Gabriela Ortega) simply loves a good confrontation. Timid Nikki (Amaya Braganza) wants to be bolder. Insecure Mojdeh (Ariana Mahallati) wants to join the sorority led by the workshop's creators, Kara (Sarah Marie Rodriguez) and Brandi (Talia Ryder)."", ""The pair know the unseen victim and want to protect themselves, protect everyone, from further harm. (That includes two guys, played by Sebastian Delascasas and Jayson Lee, who are frat brothers with the girl's attackers.) Or maybe they're just trying to absolve their guilt."", ""Putting all these personalities in an intimate environment where fears and fists are high is a setup ripe for drama. But both Padilla's script and her uneven co-direction with Rachel Chavkin and Steph Paul pull their punches."", 'All the predictable twists happen: Nikki finds her strength, two girls get into a fistfight, and the guys are complicit. But almost never does ', 'How to Defend Yourself', ' dare to plunge into murkier moral territory. The play also never lets any character truly teeter on the edge, for better or worse, of connecting with their inner aggressor.', 'The closest it gets to probing any thorny questions is a gripping scene in which Kara and Brandi spar (verbally) over the ""correct"" way to sexually desire. Brandi teaches the girls to use their voices and dictate what they want; Kara argues her preference for being silently objectified is also valid, because it\'s what she likes.', ""But in this moment and others, when we think a character will break or a true shift will occur as revelations come to light, the moment abruptly ends. Like a weak punch, there's plenty of momentum but no follow-through."", ""This theme extends to the play's end. In her desperation to show the girls — and convince herself — they can protect themselves from anything, Brandi forgets to teach them the most important rule: Run away if you can. Only engage when you have to. Nikki's newfound bravado sends her looking for a fight, and when that goes south, Brandi's mythology of invincibility comes crashing down."", 'Ultimately, at this moment, so does ', 'How to Defend Yourself', "". The girls re-confront the reality that safety isn't guaranteed, but this time they're not emboldened to take control. Instead, they walk away."", ""So what's the takeaway? That self-defense isn't worthwhile? That we should pity these girls for giving up just as they're finding their strength? That we should feel sorry they sought strength at all because whether they use it or don't, it's never enough?"", 'To be honest, none of these feel quite right. The one certain message is that an unsafe world awaits them all — us all — and always has. Padilla settles on that rather boilerplate point with a montage, in reverse, of the girls growing up and facing handsy boys at every school dance, frat party, and basement couch.', ""All this is something we women already know. So show us some new moves. Interrogate some new possibilities for how we as women can move, fight, and f--- our way through the world.

The show is adapted from Rapp's same-named 2006 memoir about events that happened in the mid-90s: his rapid rise from Starbucks barista to Broadway star, which coincided with the loss of Larson and, miles from New York, Rapp's mother.

He's since teamed up with composer/lyricist Mark Eitzel to write a musical called "", 'Cornelia Street', ', about a cafe on the brink of closure. (A ', 'December 2022 Village Sun article', ' claims Hirsch was taken by surprise, though he co-hosted a talkback with Stephens and Eitzel about his cafe last night, suggesting a since-mended fence.)', 'All this history of the Cornelia Street Cafe is rich and fascinating. The ', 'Cornelia Street', ' musical, making its world premiere with Atlantic Theater Company, is not.', 'The show is fully original — or, at most, very loosely inspired by Hirsch — centering on Jacob, whose imminent loss of his failing restaurant leads to a host of other problems. His daughter Patti has no respect for him. Neither does his other estranged daughter, Misty, who shows up out of the blue. And he has to resort to drug dealing for an extra cash flow, but a slick salesman he is not.', ""Norbert Leo Butz does a commendable job with the character, imbuing Jacob with a boyish, explosive energy and amusingly dad-level dance skills. He also benefits from the fact that Jacob is the one character we get the fullest portrait of. He's ambitious and enthusiastic but impulsive, and that gets the better of him in work (like when he blows his budget on expensive ingredients) and life (like his past extramarital affair, which resulted in Patti)."", ""But Stephens doesn't spend enough time digging into the consequences of any of that, leaving us with little reason to emotionally invest in Jacob. He instead gets distracted by the thinly drawn supporting characters, whom we're able to connect with even less. Case in point: a forced attempt at a romantic subplot between Misty and drab Google employee Jacob, spurred on by another character telling him to ask her out with no buildup as to why an attraction might grow between them in the first place."", ""That character, by the way, is Sarah, a grandmotherly figure who gets shoehorned into an even less believable romantic subplot with Jacob. (She's also a former nightclub regular and potentially clairvoyant, another two elements hardly explored.) The effortlessly magnetic Mary Beth Peil at least makes the part entertaining. Kevyn Morrow does the same for Marty, the cafe's namesake and landlord, giving the most natural performance within Neil Pepe's otherwise stilted direction. And Gizel Jiménez pours her heart into her two songs, stirring the emotions even though we don't quite know what we're supposed to feel."", 'Suffering from the opposite problem is Patti, whose Act 1 solo ""You Do Nothing"" — theoretically about how her lack of respect for Jacob leaves her no motivation to live up to his expectations — has the potential to have the most dramatic heft.

Playwright/director Erica Schmidt mostly leaves that up to you. The ambiguity keeps "", 'Lucy', ' intriguing for its uninterrupted 2 hours.', ""There is something offbeat about Ashling from her initial interview with Mary, though it doesn't immediately register as sinister. She dons mermaid leggings under mismatched, patterned maxi dresses, with jingling bangles and a smattering of random tattoos to complete the look — but that's hardly odd in New York. She's a little flighty and has a clearly put-on affect in her voice — but don't we all capital-P Perform during job interviews?"", 'And then this 30something-looking woman reveals her age, 58, and seemingly that many years\' worth of job experience. That changes things. My mind immediately went to vampire — ""kids keep me young"" is a refrain of hers. Then she drawled out ""I loooooove baby boys"" in a slightly creepy way that set off a different alarm bell in my mind. My suspicions kept flip-flopping between supernatural and sexual throughout the opening scene.', ""Both those theories proved unfounded. So what worries are left? None, perhaps. Maybe Ashling's just a slightly eccentric woman with a great skincare routine. Maybe she's just the breath of fresh, Type-B air that Type-A Mary's household needs. Mary seems to go on a similar thought journey in the opening scene."", 'But I should mention here that Mary isn\'t perfect, either. The single mother is almost concerningly fixed on her six-year-old getting enough exercise and learning to entertain herself — you worry poor Lucy might grow up to feel isolated or dysmorphic. Mary also confesses to Ashling, ""I never felt anger in my life until I had her."" But that\'s not mutually exclusive with love — isn\'t turmoil, too, just a normal part of motherhood that goes unspoken? Perhaps. Or perhaps there\'s something more concerning at play.', ""Smartly, Schmidt's play doesn't damn one woman over the other until the very last moment. In fact, if you took the best parts of each of them — Mary's fierce devotion to her kids and Ashling's freewheeling spirit — they might make one really great guardian. But it's the ugly parts of them that come to light, and only worsen, in each other's presence."", 'That\'s where the horror subtly comes in — Ashling\'s many acts that anger Mary include mostly benign things like making chicken soup or bringing Lucy gifts. We still might find ourselves siding against Mary for condeming them for no apparent reason, up until the end, when Mary powerfully reminds us that ""because I asked you not to"" is a full sentence and a message that deserves respect.', ""Schmidt's apparent point is that any seemingly ordinary instinct — be it a child's or adult's — is enough to deem a person unfit for your home or your life. The tradeoff is that "", 'Lucy', ' ultimately builds up to an anticlimax, where one might expect a coup de théâtre where we uncover some depth to Ashling, why she is the way she is.

Her brother Ryan (Brian Quijada), a hyper-masculine gym owner, is skeptical but too immature to express his concerns without grabbing or referring to his genitals.', 'By the time the audience meets Peter (Christopher Bannow), a meek, exhausted man who has driven hours to abandon the son he adopted from Korea, we are primed to hate him. We know Peter and his wife have just had a baby and decided they no longer want their adopted son. We know they put an ad online saying the boy is “eager to please.” We know he refers to the child as “Pete Junior,” but he stills plans to desert him with strangers.', 'When Robin’s wife Ash (Esco Jouléy), a no-nonsense boxer, arrives home and promptly punches Peter in the face, we all but cheer. The small, almost Brechtian break in ', 'Wolf Play', ' grabs the audience by the collar and shakes, throwing us out of the world of the play as we wonder, ""Do people really do this to their children?""', 'They do. Jung was inspired by a 2013 Reuters investigation into “disrupted” adoptions, when a parent decides a child — often adopted from another country, as in ', 'Wolf Play', ' — is too much and seeks to rehome them without going to court. Robin finds the boy, Wolf (Mitchell Winter), on a Yahoo message board, a real tool Reuters analyzed.', 'Peter and Robin want to keep the boy out of the foster system, a fate they believe justifies their illicit actions. But Ash and Ryan find Robin’s choice just as inappropriate as Peter’s. “This is grown up? Getting a child from Yahoo?” Ash spits before they bond with the boy.', ""Wolf is an invention of the boy's own mind, a persona created to protect himself from harm. He eventually reveals his Korean name, Jeenu; when he speaks, Jung designates him a separate character in the script from the narrator-like Wolf.

The violence of the state, its flawed adoption system and hidden fallout, manifests through Ash and Ryan’s boxing, choreographed by fight director Hannah “Rock” Roccisano. Wolf and the audience, meanwhile, take refuge in You-Shin Chen’s scenic design, a cluttered chaos of play objects. In this bubble, a child’s imagination both comforts and charms, concealing the sharp realities that pierce the plush surroundings.', 'Wolf is a separate entity from the puppet he sometimes connects with, a papier-mâché creature designed by Amanda Villalobos.

Alfred) tells him, so he will be worthy of his home.', 'Thus sets sail ', 'black odyssey', ', the modern retelling from Marcus Gardley running at Classic Stage Company. Stevie Walker-Webb directs a Greek chorus of actors who move as one to guide Ulysses onward as his head fills with water and he struggles to remember his bearings. Adrienne C. Moore and Lance Coadie Williams anchor the chorus, gliding from role to role with ease and grounding the heart of the piece as Artez — the proud Grand Marshall in the Second Line parade — and Alsendra, a couple taking refuge on the roof of their home during a Noah’s Ark-scale flood.', 'UptownWorks, the production company that provided sound design, plays audio of stranded storm survivors neglected by the U.S. government in transition to the flood setting, cementing a link between the Biblical stories of old and climate disasters of today. Most audiences would absorb this link without further instruction, but Artez and Alsendra then explain that God began “spitting curses on the Earth” since the murders of Malcom X and President Kennedy and has been crying 40 days and nights since the assassination of Dr. King.', 'This rather abrupt tonal shift from the subtle to the heavy-handed characterizes the main structural issue with ', 'black odyssey', ': The play is at times captivating and clever, but it is more interested in reveling in its own cleverness than in seeing its choices through. The unevenness makes Gardley’s script feel a little corny in its reliance on on-the-nose pronouncements; Ulysses welcomes us back from intermission with a cringe-worthy choral proclamation: “American Dream was a nightmare programmed to keep me asleep and broke. But I got news: I’m woke.”', 'The framing of the Greek gods playing chess with the lives of men guides ', 'black odyssey', ' through its highs and lows, and the performances all soar even as the script sours. Jimonn Cole’s bitter Paw Sidin (Poseidon) is a worthy antagonist whose earned ire provides a thought-provoking conflict, while Harriett D. Foy charms and enchants as Aunt Tina (Athena).', 'The dark comedy provides indulgent updates on Greek mythological figures that delight even as Ulysses despairs: The prophet Tiresias is now “Superfy,” shepherding Ulysses through trials with his disco moves. The Sirens threatening to shipwreck Ulysses now embody Diana Ross, Tina Turner, and James Brown, crooning and kicking in costume designer Kindall Almond’s silver sequins as the audience howls with laughter.

While those notions are individually intriguing, they don’t cohere into a collective impact in this work first seen off-off Broadway in 2010.', 'The drama revolves around seemingly mild-mannered, 30something Will (Peter Mark Kendall), newly transplanted to Boise from a small community in northern Idaho. We meet him during a Hobby Lobby job interview with Pauline (Eva Kaminsky), a no-B.S. manager who’s worked overtime to make her store a success. Pauline hires Will on the spot even though he’s vague about personal questions on the application. Why’d he leave that earlier job off his resume? No emergency contact? What’s up with that?', 'Early on, Will reveals one reason he’s come to Boise – and this store – after meeting Alex (Ignacio Diaz-Silverio), a 17-year-old coworker who was adopted as a baby by a local couple. Petulant Alex removes his earphones just long enough to tell Will to buzz off. But that’s 180 degrees from Will’s desires – and there’s a reason why.', 'While Will seeks to connect with Alex, he’s also running from his past. After a series of clunky, hesitating half-hints, we discover Will’s association with a cult-like church whose leader caused the death of a young follower named Daniel. A late scene underlines the similarities between Daniel and Alex, repeating what has already been said.', 'Will’s link to the infamous church comes out thanks to Alex’s protective older adoptive brother Leroy (Angus O’Brien), a visual artist who fashions graphic tees when he’s not stocking shelves at Hobby Lobby. Also on hand is Anna (Anna Baryshnikov), a sensitive and reserved coworker who hides in the aisles at closing time so she can stay after hours to read alone in the break room.', 'In a convenient twist, Will similarly hides out so he can write his blog, a work that reveals his religious beliefs. Will regularly summons the rapture – “Now. Now. Now.” Alex, meanwhile, often talks about killing himself.\nIt’s just a matter of time before this five-character collision turns messy. Hunter’s message, which seems to be about who Will is and who he wants to be for Alex, ends up more murky than bright.', 'Director Oliver Butler’s staging of Hunter’s breakthrough play is uniformly well-acted. It simmers with subtle unease. Per the script, the break room TV runs nonstop images of either gross surgeries or two men droning on.

And Ziegler’s script, in the hands of director Barry Edelstein, simultaneously wants to eviscerate the image of the Jewish male novelist and justify his arrogance, to tell us he only whines because he has something worth whining about.', 'The Wanderers', ' follows Abe (Eddie Kaye Thomas), a secular Jewish novelist who has found critical acclaim writing about generational trauma. He fears he had not revealed enough of himself in his earlier novels and that now, as his children grow and his marriage crumbles, he will reveal too much with his next.

Abe and Sophie began dating as teenagers, their mothers lifelong best friends, but Abe is falling head over keyboard for Julia Cheever (Katie Holmes), a famous actress who began emailing him after attending one of his book readings.', ""Holmes's casting as a heightened version of herself (minus the email affair) is the golden goose for "", 'The Wanderers', ', a play most concerned with people obsessing over how others perceive them. Holmes’s Julia is happy to be a walking muse, a lightbulb that turns on whenever Abe needs her, brightening the story with her unassuming charm.', 'Consumed by his writing, his newfound pursuit of Julia, and unresolved grief over his parents and childhood, Abe no longer sees Sophie as a person. Neither does the script. We don’t know much about her writing, her relationship to her children, or her opinions on her parents beyond petty arguments. She both refutes and agrees with Abe’s offhanded accusation that she isn’t truly Jewish because of her mixed heritage; this internal conflict for a Black Jewish woman, a character we rarely see on stage, deserves as much time as Abe’s self-righteous emails.

Not all the details about Satmar life are correct, but the play captures the tension between Esther’s love of her religious and cultural life and her desire to explore past its boundaries.', 'Klasko’s Schmuli, endearing until the moment he isn’t, has spent a lifetime associating manhood with the capacity to control.

Every plot point, every character, every moment in this nearly perfect new play, presented by ', 'Roundabout Underground', ', has been stitched together perfectly. It will make your heart bleed in many different ways; it is a thoughtful and excellent meditation on the long and winding road to healing.', ""The story centers on a dancer named Jonah, who just got out of a physically and emotionally abusive relationship. And yet, Ruben, his ex, manages to slink back into his life, knowing Jonah can't resist — restraining order be damned. Jonah is better at pushing away his grandmother Geraldine and eight-year-old daughter Ella, partly out of shame and partly as a continuation of a broken family cycle. His grandmother had pushed away his mother, who then abandoned him in childhood."", ""It's a dense plot for only five characters (Sam, Jonah's new lover, adds yet another layer and rounds out the count), but a sublime cast, bolstered by clear writing, tackle it with ease. Stephanie Berry, a not-so-hidden gem of the Off-Broadway scene, mines every depth of Geraldine as she actively works to make up for past mistakes with her daughter. She acts as a great foil to Jhardon DiShon Milton's volatile Jonah, who's still learning to do that; Phoenix Noelle (at the performance I attended) rounded out the family as Ella with poise. Separately, as Sam, the endearing Jake Ryan Lozano perfectly foiled Anthony Lee Medina, who brought a stomach-turning blend of sadism and sexiness to Ruben."", 'Every bit of their dialogue feels not only character-appropriate, but legitimately authentic. Rivers offsets Ella\'s precociousness, for example, with an adorably naive declaration of how relationships work: ""Everyone knows about boyfriends, Nana. Almost all the girls in my class have one."" That line is part of an expertly crafted scene of two conversations happening in parallel: Geraldine explains Ruben and Jonah\'s history in childlike terms, while Jonah does the same for Sam in adult terms. (', 'the bandaged place', ' may trigger those sensitive to abuse, including a terrifying moment of violence that is heard but, mercifully, unseen.)', ""Rivers seemingly leaves no detail of his play unconsidered. One scene shows Ruben gifting a necklace to Jonah, an effective metaphor for the hold Ruben has on him, even when he's absent. And there was a moment, just as I was thinking that Ruben hadn't been on stage for a while, when he suddenly appears. Whether this pacing was deliberate or not, it evidenced how trauma has a way of creeping back up just when you think it's gone."", ""Luckily, there are moments of lightness too, such as the tender courtship between Sam and Jonah that almost seems too perfect to be true. There's also a recurring theme of dance as a means of catharsis: From struggling to dance at the beginning as his memories (and a wounded knee, both courtesy of Ruben), paralyze him, Jonah makes progress by goofily dancing with Sam, and has a final breakthrough via a fierce pas de deux that depicts his and Ruben's entire journey. (The excellent choreography is by Tislarm Bouie.)"", 'Though ', 'the bandaged place', "" shows Jonah's considerable progress toward healing, the play avoids a neatly tied-up ending. Rivers doesn't suggest that Jonah and Sam will live happily ever after, or that Ruben will never reappear, or that Jonah and his family have fully patched up their troubles; doing so would have undermined the entire story.

That show dangerously romanticized its characters in the name of nostalgia for young love and innocence, and I feared this show would do the same.', ""My fears, luckily, proved unfounded. Bess Wohl's play includes romance, but sentimental and forgiving it is not. It's clear from the start that we're not supposed to root for the unnamed young lovers. Fear for them, perhaps — they are terrifyingly naive and easily seduced, and not just by each other."", ""It's almost too clear, in fact; the girl states her address as Hitler Street, which would be too on-the-nose if not for the fact that that street, and the title camp itself, was a real place on Long Island in the pre-World War II years. The German American Bund, a pro-Nazi group, operated Camp Siegfried and others to bring young Americans into the fold, with the end goal of them giving birth to yet another generation of Nazis."", ""The boy and girl's relationship in Wohl's play is thus contrived.

The boy (Johnny Berchtold), the ""runt"" of his family with an inferiority complex, has a nagging habit of calling the girl ""dummy."" The girl (Lily McInerny), soft-spoken and fearful, gets off on calling him evil. There\'s a sinister streak to their relationship that we know will doom it: She\'s fascinated by his machismo until he uses it against her. He\'s fascinated by her hidden power until it threatens his own.', ""That power comes out in a scene, the play's strongest, where the girl is delivering a speech in German. Unsure at first, she gradually gains confidence until her final sentences are a powerful, desperate cry. But there's fear in her eyes as she seems to realize the horror of what she's saying, but it's too late to stop. She's like a swimmer caught in a rip tide, whose only options are to drown or hope to be pushed out eventually."", 'But that scene exposes a disconnect in ', 'Camp Siegfried', "". It's the only time where Nazism motivates a character's actions. the The couple each already have a viciousness (and in the boy's case, his hypercritical Nazi family) that perhaps predisposes them to Nazism, not the other way around.

She's naturally skeptical when Sayet announces plans to study Shakespeare in London — Sayet insists she's using the Bard to present the Native experience to those who wouldn't otherwise listen, but her mother initially thinks Sayet is forsaking her tribe and her culture.

'Sandra' review — one-woman thriller sails calmly through dangerous territory,"David Cale's new one-woman thriller, "", 'Sandra', "", promises a globetrotting (well, from the U.S. to Mexico) mystery that lures its title character into ever-increasing danger. On paper, that's true. But this "", 'Vineyard Theatre', "" production, while it might make an absorbing novel, doesn't quite thrill as theatre, feeling less like a journey through choppy waters and more like a steady cruise."", 'The play opens with Sandra (Marjan Neshat) relaying a conversation with Ethan, her best friend, in which he says: ""“I feel like disappearing from my life."" And sure enough, Ethan travels to Mexico and doesn\'t come back. He\'s about all she has: She\'s separated from her husband and blows up most opportunities to rekindle things, and she often turns to drink immediately after insisting she shouldn\'t. Keeping with that self-destructive streak, she flies solo to Mexico to look for Ethan even though an (admittedly patronizing) FBI agent is on the case.', ""While there, she encounters a few people that, this being a detective story, we're inclined to suspect: namely, a friendly gay Manhattanite named Beauford, and an alluring half-Italian man named Luca, with whom Sandra begins an affair. He quickly emerges as the bad-guy frontrunner, though a tattoo on his arm, which I won't reveal, subtly hints at his true purpose in the story."", 'For a thriller, however, ', 'Sandra', ' doesn\'t quite succeed as a thrill ride. While Neshat is a warm and energetic storyteller, there\'s only so much she can do to add shades of nuance to a story written primarily as a sequence of ""and then this happened.""', ""Under Leigh Silverman's direction, the pacing remains even throughout, save for one scene in which Sandra scrambles to escape Luca's house while drugged.

Yet weightier events like her final confrontation with Luca, her testimony against him, and a subsequent fire at her cafe — all squeezed into "", 'Sandra', ""'s last 20 minutes — come and go in the span of a few lines."", ""Cale's script, instead, spends a lot more time than necessary dwelling on Luca's irresistible Italian sexiness, and Sandra's shock that someone like him is attracted to her, with increasing cringeworthiness. Much of "", 'Sandra', ""'s first half borders on pulp-magazine erotica rather than suspense. (So, romance novel readers who love a bad boy trope, this may be the play for you.) We — and Cale, seemingly — almost forget for a good chunk of the play that Sandra's supposed to be looking for Ethan, and by the time we come back around to that, it feels like an afterthought."", 'If expanded upon to give equal time to all its threads, ', 'Sandra', "" would make a great thriller book; it's certainly written like one already, with one narrator describing everything that happens and the reader conjuring the scenes and emotions in their mind.

Kim, the pre-show sitter). They’re questioning his status as a native-born American. Gregarious and a bit goofy, Gee must convince them of his citizenship to briefly return to Taishan to visit his wife. He says they wed in 1893 and have three kids. He hopes to bring his son back to California to work with him at his laundry.', 'That won’t be easy. In the spring of 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned Chinese people from coming to America. Gee’s interview ends and the scene shifts forward in time to Taishan. Gee’s demeanor has done a 180-degree turn. No longer meek and mild, he’s calculating and in control. Was everything he told officials a lie? Seems so.', 'He’s making a deal with no-nonsense Low (Amy Kim Waschke) in order to bring her teenage son, Moon Gyet, (Eric Yang) to San Francisco as his own son. Defying the law carries high risk and a steep price. That includes Moon Gyet giving up his name and identity.', 'The scene shifts to the Angel Island Detention Center in San Francisco Bay, where Moon Gyet, who now goes by Gee Lip Lun, is 63 days into what ends up being a 17-month stay. Interrogators question him relentlessly, looking for a tiny inconsistency that will get him shipped back to China.', 'Compliant and self-contained, the teen responds to each query. An inspector concludes that detainees answer every question because “they are always lying.”', 'The scene flashes forward once more to Taishan, where Moon Gyet has a wrenching reunion with Low. He’s there, he tells her, to “sell my name” to someone who’ll pay to accompany him to San Francisco. He needs money to pay off Gee, who helped pull strings enabling him to stay in the U.S.', 'Yuen (Shannon Tyo), pragmatic but optimistic, agrees to come to America and be his wife and bear his children.

The plot goes thus: A royal family arrives in Paris and, by happenstance, cross paths with an ordinary married couple there, and they encourage each other to make their dreams a reality.', 'All involved are chasing some kind of desire: King Belenus (Terrence Mann) wants to rekindle his love with his distant wife, Queen Roksana (Karine Plantadit), who first wants him to change. Their daughter Tooba (Gaby Diaz) wants to escape her arranged marriage to a count and marry the Parisian bellboy Jacques (Ryan Steele). Meanwhile, the Parisian watchmaker Henri (Ryan VanDenBoom) achieves his dream of designing jewelry thanks to a commission from Belenus, but his wife, Camille (Hannah Cruz), feels left in the lurch, unable to fulfill her own dream of becoming a pianist.', 'It\'s a thin plot, but the nuanced contemporary choreography makes it feel 10 times richer. ""Pixie Stix,"" a peppy number in which Tooba jaunts around Paris, shows the character\'s freewheeling playfulness. ""Work,"" in which Henri and others make Belenus\'s jewelry, begins mechanical and rote like an assembly line, and ends with Henri\'s first solo as he finally lets his creative potential run wild. Roksana\'s choreography begins subdued and hesitant, gradually growing bigger throughout the show as she musters up the courage to fully advocate for herself to Belenus.', ""Only two characters don't dance: Belenus and Camille. It's understandable for Mann, an older cast member playing a more rigid character, though Mann performs the character's few movements with suaveness and assurance.

The tomboy daughter Erica (Blanca “b” Norwood) is in the boys’ toys aisle, the closeted gay son Alejandro (Clew) in the guns aisle, the father Octavio (Raúl Castillo) in the television aisle, and the mother Maria (Elia Monte-Brown) running around the store buying food and cleaning supplies for her family.\xa0"", 'Erica narrates the story, categorizing her family not as people but as a collection of objects. “We are the things we make,” she says. “My father is a television.” But it’s not just because of overconsumption. The family lives in a trailer and works in factories, making chain-link fences and mobile homes. Their only mental escape from the drudgery is the television. Erica repeats those phrases, such as “my father is a television” and “my brother Alejandro is an unlabeled VHS cassette tape,” likely because those who are poor and undocumented, who perform the labor that Americans refuse to do, are never given an identity. It’s a poignant metaphor, rife with possibility.\xa0', 'Unfortunately, ', 'american (tele)visions', ' never give the characters personalities or growth beyond the objects they are associated with, leaving them one-dimensional and archetypes of the fallen American dream.\xa0american (tele)visions goes back-and-forth through time, slowly unfolding the story of a family who comes to the country with hope, but is eventually torn apart by tragedy. The narrative propulsion of the play comes not from the characters developing or growing or persevering, but through them (and the audience) discovering each other’s secrets.\xa0', 'The central disruption to the family is that Alejandro is gay and had a Vietnamese lover named Jesse. The narrative potential of Alejandro having a lover who is also an immigrant is never fully explored besides an ill-conceived joke about boat people. And the confounding decision to have Alejandro and Jesse be played by the same actor (Clew, who has trouble differentiating either character in their performance) means both characters are never anything more than tokens of gay suffering or prejudice. This is most troubling in the character of Jesse, who now lives with the family for an unexplained reason and mostly serves as a helper to them. The racial implication of casting an Asian man as a passive assistant is troubling.', ""Elia Monte-Brown and Ryan J.

'Straight Line Crazy' review — Ralph Fiennes towers like a skyscraper over a flat play,"On ', 'Straight Line Crazy', ""'s poster art, a pensive Ralph Fiennes towers above a diminutive New York skyline, in character as the notorious city planner Robert Moses. The image is an apt representation of the production. One can always count on Fiennes to deliver a riveting performance, but it's not quite enough to make David Hare's flat play as indelible as its subject matter."", ""Moses, as head of multiple planning committees in the 20th century, oversaw the building of numerous bridges, highways, parks, housing developments, and more. He's to thank for everything from the symphonic sounds at Lincoln Center to the perpetual congestion on the Cross Bronx Expressway. The play's first half shows him at his heyday, charming and strong-arming a snobbish Vanderbilt and a stubborn governor into supporting his plans for a highway to Jones Beach Park on Long Island."", 'The second act focuses on a rare failed project of Moses\'s: his plan to build a highway through Washington Square Park and replace the ""slums"" of Greenwich Village with upscale housing. Together, the two acts aim to show how his enterprising nature, once an asset, became his downfall when the public finally dared to defy him.', 'Hare is clearly inspired by ', 'The Power Broker', ', Robert Caro\'s incendiary 1977 biography that qualified Moses\'s many achievements with assertions that he used discriminatory and careless methods. (Many low-income ""slums"" Moses targeted for ""cleanup"" had populations of color.) Hare\'s play doesn\'t suggest that so much as knock audiences over the head with it, with lines like ""Nowadays people don’t want to be told how to live, they want to choose how to live. And they have that right"" and ""You’re no different from anyone else, Mr Moses. Sometimes you’re right and sometimes you’re wrong.""', 'Mariah Heller, a Black woman and Moses\'s new secretary, gets both these lines, along with an equally on-the-nose monologue about how Moses destroyed her Bronx neighborhood with the expressway. (Alisha Bailey acts the part well.) Whereas the characters in the first act feel like fleshed-out people, everyone is a mere mouthpiece for Hare\'s points by the second act. That\'s even true of Moses, who mostly condescends to the women on stage and off, and lists off his achievements (""achievements,"" if you will) as though dictating a textbook entry: ""Countless slums destroyed, tenements gone, to be replaced by efficient, clean housing blocks, pleasing to the eye and hygienic for the purpose of living.""', ""Fiennes manages to find the shades of emotion in a Moses written as little but bullish. The strongest moment is his final epilogue to the audience about his approach to swimming, the one skillful metaphor for Moses's career that parallels the play's opening lines."", 'Ultimately, more fascinating than the play itself are the ironies surrounding its New York debut at ', 'The Shed', "".

'Baldwin and Buckley at Cambridge' review — a mesmerizing historical recreation,"Why watch theatre instead of a YouTube video? That’s a question that might pop into your head upon seeing the synopsis for ', 'Baldwin and Buckley at Cambridge', ', the new play from Elevator Repair Service currently running at ', 'The Public Theater', '. It is a beat-by-beat recreation of a real-life televised debate between the writer James Baldwin and the conservative William F. Buckley in 1965, around the question, “Has the American Dream been achieved at the expense of the American Negro?” That debate is also available to view in full on YouTube. But this theatrical version makes a compelling case not just for the veracity of Baldwin’s arguments, but also for the importance of live theatre.', 'ERS specializes in dramatizing found texts such as novels and court transcripts (its verbatim reading of ', 'The Great Gatsby', ', called ', 'Gatz', ', was eight hours long). ', 'Baldwin and Buckley at Cambridge', ' is less overwhelming than ERS’s previous work; at just one hour, it lasts as long as the original Baldwin and Buckley debate. And it’s more straightforward than ERS’s previous shows. There are no visual flairs here to enhance the text and theatricalize it, no sheets of paper flung into the air (like in Gatz). Instead, the focus in ', 'Baldwin and Buckley at Cambridge', ' is solely on the two men and their arguments.', 'Greig Sargeant, who conceived the play with ERS artistic director John Collins, plays Baldwin, and Ben Jalosa Williams plays Buckley. Both actors are powerful orators, personable and charismatic — it’s easy to hang onto their every word. And they’re not directly mimicking their subjects. Sargeant has a more calm delivery than Baldwin does in the debate, not gesticulating as much — though his voice grows steadily more passionate as he progresses. Williams has less of a Southern drawl than the real-life Buckley, instead opting for a faux gentile delivery more reminiscent of modern conservative politicians.', 'Sure, it might be easier to watch this debate online, but with modern distractions (such as an iPhone), it’s much easier to mentally remove yourself from what you are seeing and listening to. At the Public, where the audience is seated at three sides of the stage and the house lights are on, onlookers are forced to pay attention and to hang on every word. It’s a testament to the unfortunate timelessness of Baldwin’s words that when he says of poor white people, “They have one enormous knowledge and consolation which is like a heavenly revelation: at least they are not Black,” the audience murmurs and chuckles in agreement.', 'What this recreation also allows the audience to do, that they can’t do at home, is observe these men when they’re not at the podium, to see how they watch their opponent. Here the difference in body language is stark: Sargeant’s Baldwin leans forward, his fingertips pressed together and his eyebrows furrowed in a decidedly “Is this guy for real?” manner. In contrast, Williams’s Buckley leans back on his chair, his legs spread, one arm relaxedly draped over the back of the chair, as if the event is a game. In these unspoken moments, the play goes beyond mimicry and becomes a character study: Who has true stakes in this? Whom does racism truly oppress, and for whom is racism just a concept?', 'The costumes by Jessica Jahn denote this play isn’t just a period piece. Both Sargeant and Williams are dressed in modern, close-fitted suits and dress shirts with no ties. As for their colleagues in the opening arguments, Mr. Heycock (a moving Gavin Price) wears khakis, and Mr. Burford (a slithering Christopher-Rashee Stevenson) wears slacks, short-sleeves, and a yellow sweater tied around his shoulders.', 'The subtext is clear: the words Baldwin and Buckley are speaking are from over 50 years ago, but they might as well be spoken today. Today, African Americans are still fighting against voter suppression. White Americans\' response remains, ""At least the racism isn’t as bad as it used to be."" Yet the true power of the play lies in its last 10 minutes, a fictional conversation gathered from letters and interviews between Baldwin and Lorraine Hansberry. The scene is woefully short, and should be longer, but it is the theatrical equivalent of a cold splash of water to the face.', 'When Hansberry says, “We have to find some way with these dialogues to show and to encourage the white liberal to stop being a liberal and become an American radical,” she and Baldwin look directly at the audience. There, the true genius of ', 'Baldwin and Buckley at Cambridge', ' is revealed. Listening to this dialogue may feel educational, even like medicine, but they are no substitute for radical action.', 'Baldwin and Buckley at Cambridge', ' is at The Public Theater through October 23.

'A Raisin in the Sun' review — Tonya Pinkins and Lorraine Hansberry's script are the stars of this resonant revival,"A revival of a landmark American play that enables you to appreciate it with fresh eyes and ears counts as a success – but not necessarily an unqualified one. So it goes for director Robert O’Hara’s hit-and-miss vision of Lorraine Hansberry’s ', 'A Raisin in the Sun', ', an enduringly resonant 1959 drama of a Black family in Chicago chasing their dreams and desires.', 'There are consistently fine performances by the cast, led by the estimable Tonya Pinkins as the ferociously determined, widowed matriarch Lena Younger and Francois Battiste as her precariously impulsive son Walter. The plot spins around their battle over a life insurance policy: Lena intends to use the money for a down payment on a house in the all-white Clybourne Park neighborhood to get her family out of their cramped, run-down apartment.', 'That includes her headstrong daughter Beneatha (Paige Gilbert) along with Walter and his devoted but weary wife Ruth (Mandi Masden) and their son Travis (Touissaint Battiste alternates with Camden McKinnon). Each member of the ensemble adds notes of distinction, including Jesse Pennigton as Karl Linder, who tells the Youngers they aren’t welcome in Clybourne Park.', 'Walter, a restless chauffeur, wants the money to invest in a liquor store anyway. He’s furious that his mother stomps on his plans. An unplanned pregnancy and sorely misjudged business scheme add fuel for combustion’s sake.', 'Though the story remains the same as ever, this show gets bogged down by some directorial decisions. O’Hara conjures up the ghost of Walter Sr., Lena’s late husband, a hardworking family man who’s referred to but doesn’t appear in the play. The specter actually has little impact.', 'The director also includes the Youngers’ nosy chatterbox neighbor, Mrs. Johnson (Perri Gaffney), a character cut from the drama’s three Broadway runs. She drops bombshell news about violence in Chicago suburbs that adds ominous shadows to an already ambiguous conclusion. O’Hara (', 'Slave Play', ') isn’t timid about getting downbeat.', 'The revival does urge you to look and listen intently. It uses both silence and overlapping dialogue to great effect. Family members interrupt each other as they speak, and the show rings truer than ever. An intense moment when Walter speaks directly to the audience and, in effect, implicates them in what they’re watching makes theatregoers sit up and take notice.', 'On the other hand, a moment in which we hear but don’t see Walter and Ruth talking after sex has an odd, canned quality and thuds. Another misstep comes when ethereal light beams from a hole in the ceiling whenever Lena’s late husband enters the room. The same light shines when Beneatha considers a life far from Chicago. The heavy-handed effect yields diminishing returns.', 'A Raisin in the Sun', ' leaves room for hope but always ends with uncertainty. We know the Youngers are unwanted in Clybourne Park. Mrs. Johnson infers the threat of danger. The final tableau O’Hara devises to signify the Youngers’ future seeks to be a provocation. It reads as overstatement.', 'In the end, the true star is Hansberry’s script.

Gracie Gardner, in her Off-Broadway-debut play\xa0', ""I'm Revolting"", ',\xa0adds ""skin cancer clinic"" to that list. Whether she wins any awards for it has yet to be seen (she already has a Relentless Award, among others, for her show\xa0', 'PussySludge', ""), but masterful acting and direction make\xa0I'm Revolting\xa0well worth a trip to the "", 'Linda Gross Theater', '.', 'The show\'s 90 minutes (which fly, thanks to Knud Adams\'s lively direction) are set entirely in the waiting room of the clinic. It\'s ""not the famous one"" — that would be Memorial Sloan-Kettering — not that it matters much, as both have three stars on Yelp. What emerges from there is a fresh take on the slice-of-life drama, with little capital-A Action but expertly rendered character studies. Subtle parallels emerge between the diverse ensemble members as they share (and eavesdrop on) their stories, having nothing else to do during a painstaking day of waiting.', ""We meet a total of nine characters: one is there for a routine check-in, three for outpatient surgery, and three for moral support, however bad they are at giving it. The remaining pair are doctors, floating in and out with news good and bad. I'm Revolting\xa0has put together a stellar cast for these characters, with spectacular ensemble work across the board.

Patrick Vaill, known for playing Jud Fry in\xa0"", 'Oklahoma!', ', brings a similar brooding energy to Toby, a depressed millennial whose mother Paula (Laura Esterman), a holistic medicine devotee, has guilted him into thinking he brought his disease\xa0on himself.', ""Flying largely under the radar until the play's second half are Jordan (Glenn Fitzgerald) and Liane (Emily Cass McDonnell), an unhappily married couple driven apart by Liane's cancer. Clyde (Peter Gerety), an eccentric veteran of the clinic visiting alone, rounds out the waiting-room party, providing wanted and unwanted wisdom to the newcomers. Patrice Johnson Chevannes and Bartley Booz, as the veteran doctor Denise and the young resident Jonathan, are largely one-note, but they get to showcase more depth in the poignant, if abrupt, final scene."", ""Gardner, who is also an EMT, sports her medical knowledge outright with some jargon here and there. But more subtly, her lived experience is likely what makes\xa0I'm Revolting\xa0feel so authentic even in its zaniest moments, like when Paula pulls out her singing bowls for a holistic healing session in the middle of the clinic floor. Gardner is also not afraid to investigate people's fears and mistrust of doctors, blurring the line between where it's irrational and warranted. Anna's insistence, however overbearing, that Reggie see a Black doctor and advocate for herself if something feels off isn't without merit in a world where medical racism is rampant.

Elayna Faith Randolph and Alexis Rae Forlenza share the role of Iphigenia, who is depicted in the show as a child, which makes her death that much more chilling. Randolph, the night I saw the show, twitched her body in a way as she was dying that made me queasy.\xa0"", ""But Iphigenia's death also highlights the cracks in the production. There is an explosive scene with Agamemnon and Klytemnestra arguing about sacrificing Iphigenia. There, Hille is at her most powerful.

The nondescript set, by Hildegard Bechtler, is spare aside from a long white table and picnic benches. Bechtler also dresses the characters in somber tones, aside from Iphigenia, smartly wearing bright yellow. She's the sun, and when she dies, there's only darkness.\xa0"", 'But in this modern setting, located in an unnamed country, the way the characters act makes no sense.

So why does Agamemnon kill his daughter, and why is their son Orestes (Luke Treadaway) compelled to kill his mother in revenge?\xa0', ""Most of the thematic strands that Icke added into this production are so underexplored that they end up muddying the play and undercutting its power and any catharsis.

But the attempt at relevance is unsuccessful, because it requires a more unlikeable, and less remorseful, Orestes. Despite him being onstage for a majority of the play's running time, Treadaway does not have much to do as Orestes besides being tortured and confused.

You're close enough to the stage to Lola (an incandescent Callum Francis) and her fellow drag queens (called the Angels), to admire their contouring and to see the fine craftsmanship on their boots — my eye was particularly drawn to a black and green pair of lace-up boots, and what used to appear generic green from a Broadway house is actually a patterned brocade with a sparkly white heel. Gregg Barnes's costumes are eye-popping enough for the runway at RuPaul's Drag Race."", 'Fierstein has made some changes to the show\'s book for this new version, and to reflect changing terminology. He cut every mention of ""transvestites"" from the script. It\'s a smart cut, as it means Lola is never explaining drag culture to the audience.

RuPaul would tell you to sashay away.\xa0', 'Despite these nit-picks, now is the perfect time to see ', 'Kinky Boots', '. The musical is no longer a simple feel-good tale; it\'s an important entreaty for equality.

But when Don says, ""You lookin\' for me to say men in frocks is all right?"" and Lola responds, ""I\'m not looking for you to say anything,"" the exchange packs a powerful punch now.\xa0', 'With today\'s news headlines of drag queens being terrorized by the Proud Boys, and the Don\'t Say Gay bill in Florida, we need the fantasy that Lola and her Angels provide.

"'soft' review — in moving new play, Black boys struggle to bloom","One of the most well-known songs in the 1967 tribal love-rock musical ', 'Hair', ' is a ballad called ""Easy to Be Hard"" whose lyrics are, ""How can people be so heartless? / How can people be so cruel? / Easy to be hard / Easy to be cold."" That song, sung by a woman to a man, points to how when it comes to masculinity, being hard and unfeeling is the default. And as dramatized by Donja R. Love\'s moving new play ', 'soft', ', the pressure to be hypermasculine is even more pronounced among Black boys, where hardness is an armor against a hostile world.', 'soft', ', currently running off Broadway at ', 'MCC Theater', ', takes place at a juvenile boarding school where underage Black teens with a criminal record are sent. A majority of the action is in an English class overseen by Mr. Isaiah (Biko Eisen-Martin), a newer teacher who genuinely cares about his students and their wellbeing. He encourages them to write essays about ', 'Othello', ' and express themselves in ways that are natural to them, such as through poetry or rap verse. This is despite the school\'s head Mr. Cartwright (Leon Addison Brown) telling Isaiah to care less, because, he says, ""the weight of what those boys need will crush you."" Indeed, Eisen-Martin depicts Isaiah walking around with slumped shoulders, as if pressed down by that weight of his empathy.', ""Then when one student, Kevin (an instantly memorable Shakur Tolliver) kills himself, Isaiah can't help himself from caring more about his students, even if they try to push him away. Here, director Whitney White makes the most out of the small black box at MCC. "", 'soft', "" is directed avenue style, with audiences on either side of the classroom. When the boys begin to fight with each other, the action is visceral, taking place just inches away from the audience. And when Isaiah tries to reach out to his students, such as to put a caring hand on them, they flinch and back away as if they've been burnt."", ""These boys are not even men, but they've been forced, by their tragic circumstances and by a society that already treats them like criminals, to harden. The stage, designed by Adam Rigg, is also surrounded by flowers of every color, as if to remind the audience that these boys are still just seedlings that need tending to. They need light and love."", 'The cast of ', 'soft', ' is uniformly excellent. They have an easy chemistry with each other and are individually compelling. Love is adept at writing for their different voices, such as Dharon Jones as Antoine, who keeps to himself and is always doodling in his notebook, or Essence Lotus as Dee, who is gay and the peacemaker in the group. Each of these actors are able to fill in their characters, painting a full portrait of each boy through mannerisms and the different ways that they spit verse.\xa0', 'The cast makes ', 'soft', ' a compelling new show, but at the same time, the play feels incomplete. For instance, Kevin\'s suicide drives the play, but not enough time was spent with him or seeing him interact with his classmates for his death to emotionally land. Instead, Love overrelies on dialogue to fill in those blanks, such as Isaiah saying that Kevin spoke to him before his death (though the scene is never shown), and Antoine saying he had a close relationship with Kevin, but the audience never witnesses that relationship. It risks turning this crucial character into a concept and a plot device instead of a full human being whose life was cut tragically short. Cartwright tells Isaiah, ""lives are being saved because of you,"" but the audience never sees it. There\'s too much telling rather than showing.\xa0', ""It's tough to write a play about people trapped in a hopeless circumstance, especially because in real life, many Black boys in underfunded schools end up becoming another statistic in the school-to-prison pipeline. And public schools are so underfunded that teachers are already fighting a losing battle; the students can physically see from the torn textbooks that the institution that they are in doesn't care about them, so why should they pay attention in class?"", 'In one scene, the show\'s highlight, Dee tells Isaiah, ""My life ain\'t tragic. It\'s real good. I\'m real good. Fab, actually. And I\'m becoming the most fab version of myself every day. I smile more than I cry."" Love is a poetic writer in the way he uses language, and it\'s a valiant effort to define Dee, and the other boys, through the lens of hope rather than tragedy.', 'But ultimately, ', 'soft', "" betrays itself by overly focusing on the dark instead of the light. There are no real moments of compassion and caring until the last few minutes of the play, but by that point, that hardness had formed a crust, and it's too late for that bit of humanity and light to peek through.

Through a family friend, the brother connects his sister with a local artist/songwriter, hoping them writing a song together will help her cope.', 'The minimal plot leaves room for a delicate character study of four broken people learning to let others in, despite not being sure if they want to. Arbery, having based\xa0', 'Corsicana', '\xa0loosely on his own Txas upbringing and relationship with his sister, has written this flawed but endearing quartet deeply and compassionately, and the cast give uniformly lived-in, gorgeous performances.', ""The brother, Christopher, is the stand-in for Arbery himself, and Will Dagger plays him earnestly. Though he's devoted to helping his sister overcome her grief, he's dealing with sorrow of his own, and it's touching to see him gradually open up to the aforementioned family friend, Justice (a motherly Deirdre O'Connell). Dagger also has a spot-on sibling dynamic with Jamie Brewer as Ginny, as they jump from tender moments to fights on a dime."", ""They share a subtle resentment at still living together in Corsicana, an arrangment necessitated by Ginny's Down syndrome. Similarly to Brewer's last Off-Broadway role, though (the title role of\xa0"", 'Amy and the Orphans', '), Ginny is far from helpless: she articulates her dreams and desires with confidence. When she says she\'ll make it out to L.A. and live with Zac Efron, you unequivocally root for her. At the same time, when she declares things like, ""people need to know that I\'m a good person,"" you\'re sympathetic that she, too, knows things aren\'t easy for her.', 'In the present, it\'s especially difficult for her to connect with the artist Lot, a man with a master\'s degree who claims to have proved the existence of God with experimental math, but threw it away and turned to art because ""it\'s a better delivery system"" for, supposedly, the divine. He doesn\'t know what to make of Ginny\'s frankness, especially when she says things that remind him of bad memories. Similarly, she doesn\'t know what to make of him. It\'s easy for the rough character to be unreachable by the audience, but Harold Surratt gives him softness. When he disappears for most of Act 2, he\'s missed.', ""Finally, O'Connell holds the group together as the human embodiment of a warm hug. Fresh off a Tony win for\xa0"", 'Dana H.', ""\xa0on Broadway, she's back thriving in her Off-Broadway niche. She shines especially in Act 2 as she finally expresses her own desires after stepping back to support Christopher, Ginny, and Lot for most of the play, and in one particularly sweet scene, stumbles through a flirtation with Lot."", 'She also gets a clever monologue in which she describes a piece of writing she\'s working on, about, in part, ""the belief that when a part of the self is given away, is surrendered to the needs of a particular time, in a particular place, then community forms."" Keen audiences will recognize she\'s essentially describing\xa0', 'Corsicana', ""\xa0itself.

We begin with the moms in a quaint suburban home — throw pillows embroidered with ""Home Sweet Home,"" photos of kids, a fireplace — at a meeting to decide who should introduce the newly elected president at an upcoming school visit.', 'Here, Del Rosso plays to the expected audience\'s (urban liberals) most stereotypical view of Trump voters, peppering the women\'s conversation with fear-mongering talk of ""illegal aliens"" and aborted children, and derisive doubt toward a local teenager who claims she was raped. We\'re meant to dislike them — especially PJ, who shows up proudly sporting a Confederate flag sweatshirt.', 'PJ, though, introduces a class war, as even her fellow Republicans in the room are put off by her clothing choices and brash way of speaking.

However, they spend most of their meeting quibbling over whether the others are being progressive ""correctly"" and spend the other half performing a ""white guilt ritual"" that\'s meant to help them confront their own prejudices.', ""Del Rosso's intended takeaway is clear: neither Republican nor Democratic white women are a monolith, and the two parties aren't as different as they may believe themselves to be.

'Hamlet' review — classic play holds a mirror up to today,"The expansive new production of ', 'Hamlet', ' at ', 'Park Avenue Armory', ' opens with screens. Horatio, Bernardo, and Francisco see the ghost of the recently dead King Hamlet not in person, but through a feed of security cameras, the images warping as the king flashes in and out. This gigantic screen — and the others on either side of the stage and throughout the house — brings home that this ', 'Hamlet', ' is about surveillance. The characters are always being watched, by the cameras, by each other. And when you are always expected to put on a performance, what happens when the lines between pretend and the truth blurs? Therein lies madness.', ""Robert Icke's 3.5-hour contemporary production of "", 'Hamlet', ' played to critical acclaim in the West End (with ', 'Fleabag', ""'s hot priest Andrew Scott as the Danish prince). It has transferred to New York City with a mixture of old and new cast members. Crucially, its Hamlet is new and painfully young: 27-year-old Alex Lawther (of "", 'The Imitation Game', ').', 'Lawther plays ', 'Hamlet', "" not as a world-wise adult overcome by vengeance, but as a boyish man who is feeling too much at once: grief, disappointment, betrayal, anger, loneliness. And he has no outlet for any of those feelings. Lawther's depiction of Hamlet is similar to Marcel Spears in "", 'Fat Ham', ', another superlative contemporary adaptation of ', 'Hamlet', ' currently running at the Public Theater.', 'That surfeit of feeling means that when Hamlet comes home to Denmark to find that his mother Gertrude has quickly married his uncle Claudius after King Hamlet\'s death, Gertrude saying, ""All that lives must die. Passing through nature to eternity,"" is not a throwaway line. Hamlet is obviously overcome with grief — he wears black and doesn\'t participate in the wedding festivities — but no one actually sits down with him and helps him process his pain. Instead, they all talk about him and spy on him, treating Hamlet as a problem to be solved rather than a person in need of guidance.\xa0', 'Thus Icke\'s production brings home the true tragedy of the play: It\'s not the failed revenge plot; it\'s the lack of communication. It\'s the notion that watching someone means we know them. The only time Hamlet freely speaks is when he directly addresses the audience. Lawther delivers Hamlet\'s lines slowly to the audience, in a melancholy, as if he\'s thinking of them in the moment. But when the moment of revelation hits him, such as in the line, ""The play\'s the thing, wherein I\'ll catch the conscience of the king!"", it inspires the audience to applaud.', 'At the same time, the play doesn\'t ask us to completely sympathize with Hamlet. In the ""get thee to a nunnery"" scene with Ophelia (a luminous Kirsty Rider), he doesn\'t just shout it. Hamlet physically assaults her — Rider\'s mic was off, but I could clearly hear her shout, ""Stop!"" It\'s a distressing moment that might have been needlessly provocative if not for the clarity behind Icke\'s intent: Hamlet\'s grief infects everything around him. When Hamlet brandishes a gun in the latter half of the play, it brings to mind the angry young men in countless news headlines with no outlet for their feelings aside from violence. ""I must be cruel, only to be kind,"" isn\'t just a statement here. It\'s a threat.', '\xa0', 'Just as Hamlet is not a clear hero, there are no clear villains. Jennifer Ehle\'s Gertrude and Angus Wright\'s Claudius are a couple very much in love — in the play\'s early scenes, they can hardly keep their hands off each other. This makes their hasty marriage understandable: Claudius is portrayed as a gentler figure, while Gertrude contains equal parts maternal tenderness and strength. When Claudius says, ""This is the poison of deep grief"" in reference to Hamlet\'s behavior, he isn\'t deflecting; he has a point. You get the sense that if these characters just talked to each other, a lot of pain and death could be avoided.', 'The modern-day set for this ', 'Hamlet', ' is expansive, with set and costumes by Hildegard Bechtler (though the characters look less like modern royals and more like rich Upper West Siders). The set is large but mostly spare, aside from large glass windows and a pair of Scandinavian-style couches and those giant screens. The vastness of the stage underscores the distance between the characters, and they are many times separated by a glass wall. The metaphor is obvious but effective.\xa0', 'The production also uses the music of Bob Dylan throughout. Hamlet was supposed to play in New York in 2020 at the same time as another Dylan-inspired show from the U.K.: the jukebox musical ', 'Girl From the North Country', '. In Hamlet, there\'s an obvious use of Dylan\'s ""All Along the Watchtower"" to soundtrack some war footage, but otherwise, Dylan\'s ballads ground the production. Despite all the video cameras and the stylish set, this ', 'Hamlet', ' carries a contemporary message about the importance of human connection, and how disconnecting from each other can bring deadly consequences.', 'Hamlet', '\xa0is at Park Avenue Armory through August 13.

Had I seen "", 'Oh God', ' the day I was originally scheduled to — May 2 — I would have left the theatre, checked my phone, and seen the news of the leaked Supreme Court brief on the potential repeal of Roe v. Wade.', 'It was no less harrowing to see the show four days later, and Leiby acknowledges this: At my performance, she started off by telling us that ""the show is the same"" as before the leak (she\'s been performing it around New York since 2021), but she\'s ""still exploring this as well."" ""This"" being her feelings and her fear toward reproductive rights being jeopardized, as many others in my audience — mostly young women and femme-presenting people like myself — likely were.', 'Of course, that means Leiby, with her bitterly funny bits about periods and motherhood and the daily struggles of being a woman, is mostly preaching to the choir in ', 'Oh God', "". But although I'd wager a majority young, female audience is par for the course here, that's otherwise rare. It became immediately clear to me that "", 'Oh God', "" is much more than a comedy show; it's a show of solidarity."", 'I, for one, felt incredibly seen by Leiby in the most oddly specific ways, as a fellow bespectacled only child with a history of back surgery and bad geography skills whose inability to keep even a cactus alive doesn\'t bode well for child-rearing. Leiby also talked during her entire abortion (another thing I\'d probably do), having been only partially sedated. But what really stood out about that anecdote, besides it being one of her funniest, is that it\'s more about Leiby as a chatty person than Leiby as a person who had an abortion. Substitute ""abortion"" for wisdom tooth removal or eye surgery, and it would have the same hilarious effect.', ""That's the vibe of\xa0"", 'Oh God', ""\xa0as a whole: Despite the title, it's not really a show\xa0"", 'about abortion', '. It\'s about abortion in the sense that Leiby had one, and she mentions what the options and process are like, doing a better job than a lot of actual sex education. But most of the show is filled with stories about mundane and widely relatable things relating to sex and womanhood: the awkward sex talk she had with her mom over Caesar salads, how women still can\'t talk about periods openly with men, and the overly chipper nature of birth control commercials — they show ""musicals breaking out in a grocery store"" when according to Leiby, they should really show a woman having a nightmare about being stuck with a crusty man and his child.', ""In other words, by not hyper-focusing on her abortion for the entire 70 minutes, she normalizes it, and shows herself as a complete and complex woman separate from motherhood. Leiby stresses that doesn't define or change her, and that abortion is something we can and should talk about in everyday conversation, not just when it's in crisis."", ""Now doesn't feel like the time to be laughing about anything remotely related to abortion — but at "", 'Oh God', ', it was a way to cope. Leiby offers that with skill and respect for the gravity of the current situation. She should really rename her show ', 'Oh Good, A Show About Abortion', ', and all types of people should bear witness to it.\xa0Her story is more necessary now than ever.', 'Alison Leiby: Oh God, A Show About Abortion', '\xa0is at the Cherry Lane Theatre through June 30.

'Wish You Were Here' review — a compassionate look at Iranian culture,"In Sanaz Toosi's "", 'Wish You Were Here', ', five Iranian women grow together and apart from each over the course of 13 years. Their conflicts transcend the simple mundanites that comprise modern friendships. Though those issues (petty rivalries and jealousy) also appear, they play second fiddle to the compromises and personality changes that each woman is forced to undergo in the face of violent revolution.', ""The year is 1978, and five women have joined to celebrate Salme's (Roxanna Hope Radja) wedding. Though they are all boldly vulgar and silly ― and given to making jokes about their vaginas ― it is clear that none of them have ever had sex. Shideh (Artemis Pebdani) in particular enjoys taking digs at her companions over their supposed ignorance, even as she is the biggest prude of all. Zari (Nikki Massoud), is her polar opposite ― the kid sister playing at adulthood, whose best efforts inadvertently reveal her precious naviete, while Salma helps to maintain peace with self-assured kindness and appreciation for everyone around her."", 'Though most of the group are Muslim, at this point it was still safe for Iranian Jews to live in the country. Case in point: Rana (Nazanin Nour), who is Jewish, along with her best friend Nazanin (Marjan Neshat), the clear leader of this smart, poised, ready-to-conquer-the-world pack. Unfortunately, in the next scene, Rana has disappeared, and though it is clear they all miss her to certain degrees, only Salme bothers to look for her.\xa0', ""Director Gaye Taylor Upchurch elegantly indicates this loss of innocence with the group of women coming together to lift Salme's dress off her from above. Suddenly, the play has moved forward into the Iranian Revolution ― during which shows of religious piety became the rule of land, complete with women being barred from attending university. Uncowed, Shideh leaves to study in the United States, while Salme becomes more religious than ever. Happily, her religious devotion does not distract her from her compassion and love for her friends.\xa0"", 'Sadly, in another shift forward in time, it emerges that Salme has died, leaving Nazanin and Zari, who do not care for each other, as the last of the group.', ""Zari is married now and following a custom to forgo bathing more than a few times a week. Nazanin is clearly disgusted, though forced to compromise with her new reality when Zari saves her from embarrassment. In time, Nazanin breaks her own vow not to marry and accepts Zari as her new best friend, though even this taming of her spirit proves small comfort when she faces additional loss. The play concludes with a visit from ghosts of Nazanin's past and the realization that she has lost everything she thought she wanted.\xa0"", ""Much like Toosi's "", 'English', ', which premiered earlier this year at ', 'Atlantic Theater Company', ', ', 'Wish You Were Here', "" is another gorgeous and humanizing look at Iranian culture with a deep regard for what its citizens have been asked to sacrifice. Such compromise seems unthinkable to Americans, even as we are in the middle of a violent political upheaval of our own. In reflecting on each character's evolution, one realizes how easy it is for an unthinkable reality to become normalized ― especially when one loses access to their dreams and loved ones.\xa0"", ""The production is simple and perfect, from Arnulfo Maldonado's economic set to Sarah Laux's authentic costumes and Upchurch's deft hand at arranging the bodies in beautiful tableaux. However, the cast's acting was more understated than necessary. At times I wished to hear greater characterization in the vocal performances, particularly in the opening scene, if only to set a high point for when these women felt truly free.\xa0"", 'Despite my personal feelings, many of my theatre colleagues and people from Iran who have seen the play have said they found the acting entirely true to life and perfect.

'Exception to the Rule' review — an eye-opening stint in detention,"With ', 'Exception to the Rule', ', provocative playwright Dave Harris takes audiences into the broken carceral system that exists within predominantly Black high schools across the nation. The only problem with this ', 'Roundabout Theatre Company', ' production is that it gilds the lily by presenting the action as if it were a thriller, when the play is actually documentary theatre.', ""The show opens with a group of rowdy kids reporting to detention. There is Mikayla (Amandla Jahava, a total spitfire) whose infraction is wearing too short a skirt; Dasani (Claudia Logan), who simply wants to serve her time in peace; the mad-dog Dayrin (Toney Goins), who continues to bare his fangs even after he's been trounced; wannabe loverboy Tommy (Malik Childs); peaceful-until-he's-set-off tough guy Adbul (Mister Fitzgerald); and Erika (MaYaa Boateng), an overachiever who the students worship as the girl who will make it out of the hood."", 'With the exception of Erika, they all know the drill because they are repeat offenders with no hope of redemption — even though an intercom announcement frequently reminds them that detention is meant to help them become ""a better, more agreeable person."" Clearly the system is not working. Despite that, their warden/teacher, Mr. Bernie, doesn\'t have to show up for them to obey the orders that have been imposed upon them.\xa0', ""Harris's point is that in Black-majority K-12 education, detention often approximates prison. Having taught in NYC schools since 2004, I agree. With their barred windows and metal detectors, many public high schools look like prisons. Worse, they replicate slave culture by transforming students into compliant drones with frightening triggers."", 'During my final teaching assignment at a charter school in Bedford-Stuyvesant, that trigger was the word ""bowl,"" which compelled children to hold their wrists in front of them as if they were shackled together and to blow air into their cheeks as if they were goldfish. When I asked a colleague what this meant, I was told that ""we put a bowl in their mouths and hands so that they can\'t speak or do anything wrong."" But children who cannot speak are unable to defend themselves. And so it is in ', 'Exception to the Rule', '.', 'The trigger that keeps these students in check is a warning about consequences with ""zero tolerance"" for breaking the rules. ""If you don\'t know what that means,"" an intercom announcement warns, ""then we will give you a detention."" This lack of logic becomes more absurd, though no less realistic as the play continues.', 'The only person to question this system is Erika. Boateng\'s casting as the darkest skinned person in the production is striking because Erika is a perfect student who has learned to play ""white."" This comes to a head after she lashes out at everyone around her for their failure to understand the system.', 'Erika has made many sacrifices to escape the fate of her community. But in swallowing that poison pill, she has become as detestable as the people who will one day discriminate against her ― even as they hold her up as ""one of the good ones.""', ""Sarita Fellows's costume design is straight out of any high school in Brownsville. Kamil James and Reid Thompson's co-design of the set feels like the soul-sucking classroom of an actual high school.

""It was — harrowing."" He\'s afraid a glitch will arise just as the adoption appears to be a done deal.', ""We learn that the men knew each other in passing in high school, where a decade and a half earlier, Ryan was the popular kid and Keith was the outlier.

The play, which is playing at MCC Theater, follows Judy (Sas Goldberg) and Jeff (Max Jenkins), two extreme fans of Idina Menzel waiting at the If/Then stage door for her autograph.', 'That premise expands into a look at what actors waiting for their big break do to stay afloat financially and artistically. The play provides an unflattering, if not accurate, anthropological dive into the assumptions about how theatre prioritizes looks and heterosexuality. In this instance, the show is devoted to white gaze and its lust for appealing to straight white men. Although Black and other people of color are left out of the discussion, it is understood that the harm caused by catering to these beliefs is as harmful to them as it is to other white people.\xa0', ""Judy and Jeff function as the other white people in this capacity. Judy resists, resents, and is unable to operate as a sexy leading lady ― despite her Broadway-ready voice ― while Jeff, her best friend, is a one-hundred-footer gay, i.e. you can tell that he's not straight from one hundred feet away. Though both rail against the unfairness of it all, they remain devoted to the idea of baring their souls through song and fanning the flames of leading lady fandom.\xa0"", 'Their particular devotion to Idina Menzel comes from their belief that she is a normal everyday type who got where she is because of her hard work and incredible talent as opposed to the freak, sui generis allure of someone like Carol Channing. In this way, Menzel fuels their hope that one day, they too will make it. In the meantime, Judy keeps herself afloat as a real estate agent, while Jeff runs a popular fitness class and workshops where women can learn how to be better caricatures of women. He also has a drag show devoted to Barbra Streisand.', 'However, after Judy meets Mark (Evan Todd) at an audition and begins dating him, things start to change. Mark is the prototypical straight-presenting white man to whom musical theatre caters, despite Jeff insisting that the field was created by gay men who wrote their socially unacceptable desire into roles for leading ladies.\xa0', ""Mark is tall, attractive enough, and interested in having sex with whomever he wants without dealing with the consequences of being labeled. This causes friction after he joins Judy and Jeff's stage door tradition, and Jeff assumes that Mark is gay.\xa0"", ""Playwright Nogueira dissects the socio-sexual politics of white patriarchy and its hold over musical theatre in her play, and the results are didactic, well-rendered, and entirely thrilling. In an attempt to have it both ways, Nogueira interrogates Judy's disdain for putting women on a sexual pedestal through an unnamed character (Michelle Veintimilla, who is Ecuadorian though white exotic presenting). Judy assumes that the actress is an arrogant idiot who gets by on her looks, but soon learns that her sexuality doesn't define her. \xa0"", ""And though Veintimilla gives her plot-device character greater depth than she deserves, I'd rather Nogueira had left her out of the piece altogether―or given her own play.\xa0"", 'Which Way to the Stage', "" ends abruptly with Judy experiencing an out-of-nowhere breakthrough.

She is the source of Eva\'s suicidal ideation and dysmorphia, as well as Julie\'s overwhelming emotional paralysis."" This piece of information is given by the narrator, on whom the play over-relies to comment upon the proceedings. The device is clever initially but becomes a cop-out as the play progresses, a way to tell the audience what is happening instead of showing them.\xa0', ""Unfortunately, Julie and Eva are much less interesting than the play's supporting characters, which includes a quietly affecting Michael C. Liu as a Chinese professor who is imprisoned and tortured for trying to find a way to bypass the Golden Shield, and Max Gordon Moore as the pompous and amoral ONYS president who places money above human rights.\xa0"", ""That is because Julie and Eva's damage — trauma from abuse and an identity crisis of being Asian American in between two different cultures — is enough to power its own play. And as recent films like "", 'Everything Everywhere All At Once', ' or ', 'Turning Red', "" showcase, there's an ample well of storytelling in the fraught relationship between Asian women and their families. Unfortunately, the sisters' story is shoehorned inside of a play already filled to the brim with themes."", ""Even though the sisters are positioned as the lead characters, even on the show's posters, they are the most one-dimensional. Though Cheung and Qian valiantly try to round out their characters through body language, the script does not give them adequate motivation for why they're even taking on the case, putting them at an emotional remove from the central tension of the play. And the slip of the reason "", 'Golden Shield', ' gives seems like self-hatred at being Asian, which, to its detriment, the play does not explore.\xa0', ""The trial and its buildup are the focus here, so much so that every time the narrative goes back to Julie and Eva having the same circuitous non-conversation about their family, it stops the play cold and robs it of energy. Their conflict seems merely a plot device to inject unnecessary drama into the proceedings, as if taking a foreign nation to court isn't interesting enough."", ""It's unfortunate because "", 'Golden Shield', ' has the ingredients to be an important and prescient piece of theatre, and King is a formidable new voice to watch.

Writer/performer Somi Kakoma proves this to be true. Her poetic retelling of the music pioneer\'s life is simple without being underwritten, hopeful without being kitschy, and celebratory of Makeba\'s music as well as her activism, leaving the audience inspired to continue her fight for justice and equity.', 'It\'s 2008; Obama has just been elected, and Makeba (Kakoma) is glowing with joy and energy. We\'re in Castel Volturno, Italy, watching her perform a concert. She\'d retired years ago, she tells us, but makes exceptions for ""very special causes"" (in this case, a benefit for the families of South African migrants)\xa0 — ""or very special money."" But there\'s a not-so-subtle sense that this might really be her last performance, as a chorus of four ancestors appear around her, interrupting her performance to repeatedly insist, ""It\'s time.""', 'Indeed, Makeba died of a heart attack during that very concert in real life. But\xa0', 'Dreaming Zenzile', '\xa0offers a much more satisfying, if no less sad, interpretation of that event. Makeba pushes back on the ancestors at first, saying she still has so much to give and fight for. But as they take her through her most formative memories, she arrives at a sense of peace and closure,\xa0recognizing the fullness of her life and how her voice will indeed outlive her.', ""An overarching subtlety makes this show work seamlessly. Lileana Blain-Cruz's light-handed direction and Marjani Forte-Saunders's simple but expressive choreography smooth out the transitions between concert snippets and memories so they're nearly unnoticeable, yet completely clear. The show's emotional shifts are just as effortless, from the joy of love to the pain of loss to the urgent anger of activism."", 'One moment, we see Makeba get mistreated by her first love; the next, we see her falling for her true love under the glow of sunlight (the gorgeous lighting design is by Yi Zhao). Shortly after celebrating the ""sweet sound of American jazz"" when she first arrives in New York, Makeba is shunned by both the U.S. and South African governments for releasing anti-apartheid music. The realm of her ancestors soon seems like her only true home left, as they remind her by\xa0only using her given first name, Zenzile.', 'That said, Makeba\'s music, as sung by Kakoma, is utterly joyous throughout. Her energetic, upbeat anthems, like the opening ""Iphindlela,""\xa0will make you want to get up and dance in the aisles. And even her ballads about strife are so soulful that they still buoy the spirit, if only because we know that Makeba survived so much hardship and inspired so many. Kakoma\'s performance does the same; she\'s tender, honest, and utterly captivating to watch.', ""The chorus play multiple characters in addition to the ancestors, all very well. Phindi Wilson, as Makeba's mother among other characters, deserves special mention for her powerhouse voice that all but brings the roof of "", 'New York Theatre Workshop', "" down. She and the ancestors sing traditional, prayerful African folk songs in between Makeba's songs, and Wilson's cries alone could shake the gods from the sky."", 'Dreaming Zenzile', "" falters slightly in its second act, as the cycle between the concert and her ancestors' interruptions, her ancestors' chants, and Makeba's memories becomes somewhat redundant. Overall, though, this bio-musical is an excellent one that feels fresh\xa0amid the many others on Broadway and beyond right now.

Afong Moy, the first-known woman to arrive in the U.S. from China, was presented as a novelty attraction for Americans who paid 25 cents admission. Here, she speaks from behind a gilded frame and through time, exploring her role as an object of cultural exchange while asserting her obvious humanity.', ""It's a double act of history and drama that urgently addresses the present moment, amid an alarming spike in harassment and hate crimes against Asian-Americans. (The play was initially presented at Barrington Stage Company in July 2018.) Under the direction of Ma-Yi Theater Company's artistic director Ralph B. Peña, the production at The Public Theater is an evocative and eye-opening excavation of difference and a seductive appeal for greater understanding."", 'It\'s 1834 and Afong Moy (Shannon Tyo) is 14-years-old, she tells the audience. She was born in Guangzhou Province, the youngest of seven, and sold to traders of Far East imports to New York, where she\'s now being presented as a museum exhibit. She and the square room where she sits are intended to be representative of China. Of course, both are symbolic émigrés. ""This room is unlike any room in China,"" she says. ""And I am unlike any lady to ever live.""', 'Afong is attended by a translator and sometime handler, Atung (Daniel K. Issac), whom they wrly agree is ""irrelevant"" — because he\'s not on display, and is figured as a cipher for information. Though Afong addresses the audience herself, in unaccented English, whether or not she actually possesses a voice remains an open question.', 'Afong\'s sale was only meant to last two years, but here she is at 16, and again at 29. ""You want to understand more about the world,"" she addresses onlookers with naivete at the outset, her face painted white. The years tick by, her makeup comes off, and Afong\'s veil seems to lift each time she performs the same routine — reciting her origins, walking on bound feet, pouring herself tea. As an adult, downgraded from museum exhibit to cheap circus wonder, she moves into recounting the exploitation of Chinese people during her lifetime in the U.S., as railroad laborers and targets for exclusion and attack.', ""Formally, Suh's play is presentational, a study of captivity and vehicle for lesser known histories. If the staging feels hemmed in and nearly claustrophobic, that would seem by design. While Atung paces in front, Afong remains trapped behind a frame, the abundance of artificial flowers and greenery around her fading and disappearing with time (set design is by Junghyun Georgia Lee and projections by Shawn Duan). Her finery serves as a sort of mask (the intricate costumes are by Linda Cho). She longs for escape, but where would it lead?"", ""Suh's play excels when Afong and Atung spar directly, moments positioned as asides to Afong's primary mode of storytelling. It's easy to wish the pair would break out of their fated repetition for more behind-the-scenes, no-bullshit looks into the muck of performing one's difference for others' benefit, and engage with each other and the world more fully. That would also seem by design."", 'Tyo does remarkable work embodying Afong over a half-century span, incrementally transforming from something like a doll, her voice high and almost grating, into a woman shouldering the impossible weight of representing East to West. Isaac likewise performs a subtly astounding transformation of character, animating a so-called irrelevant puppet into a weary and conflicted older man.', 'The Chinese Lady', "" goes beyond an indictment of the imperial gaze, peering through the space that allows someone to be considered an other and asking what it's made of.

What ', 'Little Girl Blue', "", named after Simone's debut album, fails to do is celebrate a complex personality, a nuanced human being, and a proud Black woman who could not — and never wanted to — be put in a box."", ""The two-act musical weaves together a set of concerts spanning eight years and two continents. Shoko Kambara's set design is minimalistic and practical, but it gives the feel of an intimate concert setting. In the first act, we're introduced to Eunice Kathleen Waymon (Simone's birth name), a woman obsessed with Johann Sebastian Bach, who had dreams of playing classical music rather than over-saturated jazz tunes, attending Curtis Institute of Music and performing at Carnegie Hall."", ""Quickly into the second act, the audience is introduced to the afro-wearing, pro-Black Simone, a woman categorized by her bipolar depression, her controlling husband (never actually seen on stage), and the music that arose from the pain. Costume designer Ari Fulton intricately sets the tone and timeline through Simone's dress; however, the opening's Cinderella-like attire and subsequent understated show pieces pale in comparison to the real singer, who served as an unapologetic visual to her expressive love songs and political music. Simone famously adorned head wraps like a queen and sported loud jewelry and bold prints like the free spirit she was."", 'What this show does get right is Michelle\'s undeniable powerhouse voice. The music is there, and every time she opens her mouth, the melodies pour out glistening waterfalls.

'Suffs' review — a historical and history-making musical,"There's one moment in "", 'Suffs', "" that will make you want to get up and raise your fist. It's early on in Act One, during a 1913 protest where over 5,000 women, wearing white, marched on Washington to demand the right to vote. In real life, suffragist and lawyer Inez Milholland led the procession astride a white horse, wearing a crown and cape. "", 'Suffs', '\xa0impressively recreates that moment, with the powerful Phillipa Soo coming out on a full-size replica of a horse as she sings ""women of the country"" as high and clear as a bell.

Taub wrote the book and the songs and stars as Alice Paul, the National Women's Party leader who helped organize that 1913 suffrage parade. The story primarily follows Alice as she encourages her fellow suffragists to do more publicly disruptive political actions, butts heads with the older generation of suffragists, and compromises the movement for equality by prioritizing white women over Black women."", ""It's a complex undertaking, with a lot of behind-the-scenes strategizing and infighting to dramatize.

Act One then dramatizes the conversations with President Woodrow Wilson, the forming of the National Women's Party, the campaign against Wilson's reelection, and the death of a suffragist. Because Taub musicalizes multiple protests, each subsequent rallying cry takes on a certain monotony. By the end of Act One, when the suffragists hold the first public protest in history at the White House, the emotional and historical impact is lost.\xa0"", 'The benefit of doing a musical instead of a play is that music can be used as a shorthand, to make audiences emotionally connect to characters without needing to know their entire life story. Unfortunately, aside from Alice\'s catchy ""I want"" song, where she sings that she will ""be the one to finish the fight, the fight for equality,"" the other characters\'\xa0songs are mostly musicalized biographies, all verses and no chorus.\xa0', ""In one scene, Soo's Inez asks Taub's Alice if they can talk about something other than suffrage. This seemed like a moment to get to know each woman on a deeper level. Instead, the characters discuss their next protests. It's a missed opportunity to show the humanity behind the women doing the work and get the audience emotionally invested in them as people, rather than as characters in a history book.

Yes, you're unwittingly put at the kid's table, from which you get to watch 70 minutes of enjoyable, though trite, wisecracking and wisdom-sharing about the unbreakable bond between\xa0love and pain."", ""Heartbreak's an odd fixation to have at a wedding, but then again, Carlo is attending that of an ex-girlfriend, Eva (Rebecca S'Manga Frank). Having failed to RSVP, Carlo envisions her surprise appearance as the stuff of rom-coms: She hopes Eva will realize Carlo is her one true love, who will save her from a tragically generic, heterosexual marriage. (More on that in a bit.) Carlo spends only one scene advancing that mission; most of the play sees her drinking — heavily — in an equal attempt to work up courage and drown her heartbreak, while falling into conversation with various wedding guests in a\xa0"", 'Company', '-style sequence of vignettes.', 'Each guest falls somewhere different on the love spectrum: There\'s Eli (Will Rogers), an earnest-to-a-fault English teacher on a potential fast track to heartbreak of his own.

And the mysterious, alluring stranger Leigh (Han Van Sciver) matches Carlo\'s jabs at love wit-for-wit, but gets her the closest to forgetting about her loneliness.', ""Wiseman, the connective tissue between them all, achieves the remarkable feat of keeping the audience's focus off the gigantic red-and-orange floral arrangement above the stage (the showpiece of Maruti Evans's rustic event hall set), and not just because her curly red hairdo is nearly as big. Wiseman's wit is sharp, her vulnerability tender, and her charm ineffable, even as she's wallowing in self-pity and picking fights with a bridesmaid (her comically similarly-named frenemy Carly, played by Keren Lugo)."", 'Unfortunately, save perhaps for Leigh, all the other characters\' development gets sacrificed to accommodate Carlo\'s huge presence and narrow view of true love. It was most disappointing to see this happen to Eva — her big day is in the title, after all! She had the potential to be explored as a bisexual woman healthily moving on from a past relationship, but instead, she\'s reduced to a trope of the lesbian who ""betrays"" the lesbian community by falling for a man.', 'One redeeming way to intepret these bits of\xa0', 'At the Wedding', '\xa0is that it actually takes place through Carlo\'s point of view, and there is evidence for that: The guests Carlo socializes with are likely to be an unmemorable blur if she\'s drunk.\xa0Some of the decorations seem to conflict — one balloon that reads ""Love is sweet"" suggests a candy theme, whereas an ""Anchored in love"" banner on the hors d\'oeuvres table suggests a nautical one — not that it would matter to Carlo, who sees the whole ceremony as generic and ""extremely heterosexual"" anyway. And a neon sign on the wall reads ""til death,"" with the ""do us part"" nowhere in sight, which is just about as bleak as you\'d expect from Carlo\'s mind.

Even as Rachel Hauck's white-pillared set frames it handsomely, Morriseau shows us there is something corrosive about this institution. After all, only a place ruled by white supremacy would require its Black faculty members to lead a hate crime investigation if they want a resolution."", ""Following this introduction, we are introduced to Malik (Elijah Jones, suave), a brilliant student arguing against a lower grade than he expected on one of Sandra's assignments. Though his comparson between plantation conditions in the modern-day workforce and slavery during the Civil War is apt, Sandra finds it underdeveloped."", 'This sequence feels like a wink to the audience that ', 'Confederates', ' will soon dive deeper into that very comparison and reveal everything that Malik has neglected. It does so by transporting us back to the eve of the Emancipation Proclamation, when Sara (Kristolyn Lloyd, enthralling), an enslaved Black woman, is tending to her brother Abner (also Jones), who has run away from their plantation to join the Union army.\xa0', 'Sara wishes to join the fight for liberation, and her former mistress and abusive childhood ""friend"" Missy Sue (Kenzie Ross) soon enlists her. Missy Sue has returned home from a failed marriage with a bit of enlightenment about abolition, and she blackmails Sara into spying on her father, a general in the Confederate army. In addition to placing Sara directly in the line of danger, Missy Sue also makes clear that she is in lust with her ― all the while framing her displays of love as something they both want.\xa0', ""In a return to the modern era, Sandra proceeds with her investigation by lulling colleagues and students into revealing more than they realize. During one such discussion with her white teaching assistant Candace (also Ross), Sandra confronts the racial dynamics of white allies who assume that their proximity gives them authority. Candace hero-worships Sandra and feels she can freely criticize Malik's complaints on the grounds that she and Sandra are both fighting the patriarchy while negating how Sandra and Malik are Black people in the maw of white academia.\xa0This framing is uncannily similar to the arguments that white feminists made to Black women when asking them to vote for Hillary Clinton against Barack Obama."", 'Sandra shuts that down just as she rebukes her colleague Jade (Andrea Patterson, thrilling as always), who accuses Sandra of undermining her bid for tenure. Sandra believes Jade coddles their Black students, while Jade argues that hard-ass professors like Sandra, who insist that Black students work twice as hard for half as much, are as destructive as overt racists.\xa0Patterson also plays Luanne,\xa0a lighter-skinned enslaved woman who uses sexual favors to secure her position as a house slave — playing the only card she has.

Whiteness, she explains, makes people see themselves as the default, with an inalienable right to take up space and power, unquestioned, at the expense of all others.\xa0(It's the system that likely allows me, a white critic, for example, to review a show centered on a Black woman's experience without people dismissing my credibility out of hand.)"", 'Help', ' retains this thesis and\xa0expertly expands upon it.

'To My Girls' review — a comedy about friendship that needs more heart,"During one scene transition of the new Off-Broadway comedy ', 'To My Girls', ', there is a mashup of Britney Spears\'s ""Toxic"" and Sixpence None the Richer\'s ""Kiss Me."" It\'s a combination that\'s tonally so opposite you wouldn\'t think it works, but it, to put it frankly, slaps. Unfortunately, the rest of the play does not live up to the imaginative promise of that remix.\xa0', 'To My Girls', ', currently running at ', ""Second Stage's Off-Broadway space"", ', uses a tried-and-true dramatic formula: longtime friends reuniting for one weekend, a well-designed living room, and alcohol. JC Lee, who has also written for ', 'Girls', ' and ', 'Looking', ' on HBO, does breathe new, contemporary life into the American living room play by adding a diverse cast of characters of different races, as well as a healthy dose of millennial angst.\xa0', 'To My Girls', "" takes place over one weekend in Palm Springs, as a group of 30something gay men reunite after the Covid-19 pandemic. Curtis (Jay Armstrong Johnson) is an Instagram influencer who is becoming increasingly insecure about his body as he's nearing 40. Castor (Maulik Pancholy of "", '30 Rock', "") suffers from self-esteem issues because he's not conventionally attractive (in other words, he does not have a six-pack) but overcompensates by being annoyingly opinionated. Leo (Britton Smith) is the peacemaker of the group who is also addicted to social media. Then there's the AirBnB host, Bernie (Bryan Batt of "", 'Mad Men', "", who steals the stage every time he's on it, which is not enough), a Gen X-er perturbed by all the vain young men around him."", 'As soon as the friends reunite, the shade comes fast and furious. Says Curtis to the group: ""We always have each other because we\'re a family and family is forever."" To which Castor remarks: ""Just like herpes.""', 'Between drinks, dancing, and lip syncing to Katy Perry and the Pussycat Dolls, the friends realize they may have outgrown each other. Friendship breakups are as painful and heartbreaking as romantic breakups, but they are so rarely dramatized. And unfortunately, ', 'To My Girls', ' spends less time establishing the bond between why these millennials are friends and more on trading clever barbs — it is true that friends are allowed to be brutally honest with each other, but there is an odd lack of care and heart shown between the men. Which means when their conflicts come to a head, the gravity of the moment is lost. Witticism and audience laughter undercut every sensitive moment of bonding.', 'It\'s a shame because the script does have moments of insight about 2022 living, such as the one-dimensionality of social media, being fetishized on Tinder, and the generational differences among gay men. For instance, there is one scene where Leo says to Curtis, ""\u200b\u200bI won\'t go along with racism dressed as fetish. It takes daily work to remind myself I am deserving of love. So when some mediocre boy in a gay bar tells me he\'s not into Black guys and that\'s \'just a preference,\' I need every fiber of my being not to collapse inward in judgment."" That Curtis responds to that proclamation by hitting on his friend is a thread the play does not adequately resolve.\xa0', ""The characters that develop most in the play are Curtis and Castor.

Pancholy manages to be annoying, funny, and sweet at the same time. And when Castor is given room to be more introspective, he excels in delivering the material. Though he's well-suited in temperament, Pancholy may be too good-looking. When Castor talks about his body insecurities, it's hard to believe since Pancholy (while he doesn't have a six-pack) isn't exactly a schlub. Having a two-pack instead of a six-pack doesn't make you hideous, especially not in the fatphobic world of online dating."", ""It is ironic that for a play with such self-proclaimed progressive characters, the Black character, Leo, played by Smith in a grounded and subtle performance, is the least developed. Leo's function is to help Curtis and Castor along and comment on their antics, which gives his role a stereotypical overtone. The character deleting Instagram from his phone should signal a moment of growth, but it's so underwritten that it feels like an afterthought.\xa0"", ""But under Stephen Brackett's direction, "", 'To My Girls ', ""does move quickly, with some genuine laugh-out-loud moments.

To Sussman\'s credit, none of the Harmonists feel overwritten at the expense of others, though Erich\'s triumphant number ""Your Son Is Becoming a Singer"" makes Peters into an early standout, and he continues to be so as his character\'s secrets are revealed.

'Cyrano de Bergerac' review — James McAvoy leads a classic for the masses,"Cyrano de Bergerac is having a pop culture moment lately. It's been 400 years since the real Cyrano lived and more than 100 since Edmond Rostand made his life into an 1897 play, but the skilled writer who, believing himself ugly and therefore unlovable,\xa0uses his talents to help another man woo his love was just the subject of a musical film starring Peter Dinklage. Now, British director Jamie Lloyd's fresh take on "", 'Cyrano de Bergerac', ' is making its American premiere\xa0at the ', 'BAM Harvey Theater', "", three years after debuting to acclaim in London. It's different from the lavish period film in every way, and it's worth the trip to Brooklyn."", ""Lloyd's "", 'Cyrano', ""\xa0lives comfortably in anachronism. Classics purists will still find the rhyming-couplet poetry of Rostand's play intact, but\xa0Martin Crimp's freewheeling adaptation will also delight the Gen-Z crowd:\xa019th-century verse gives way to 21st-century spoken-word poetry and rap, including plenty of red-hot roasts.\xa0Think "", 'Hamilton', "", but faster (yes, it's possible) and with no accompaniment but a single beatboxer (Vaneeka Dadhria). To that point, Lloyd has stripped "", 'Cyrano de Bergerac\xa0', ""down to its bare essentials: no props, no period sets or costumes, only a torrent of words. Lloyd's reasoning? Words are powerful, needing nothing else to make them effective when crafted well."", 'Nothing else besides a deft wordsmith, of course, and here it\'s the intoxicating James McAvoy in his New York stage debut. As the lovestruck yet insecure Cyrano, he delivers ferocity, vulnerability, and passion in quick succession, and you\'ll want — and need — to hang on every word that Crimp has given him.\xa0Ferocity comes first: He introduces himself by leaping downstage and challenging another character to a ""swordless"" swordfight (no props, remember) at a ', 'Hamlet', '\xa0performance. But McAvoy wields a microphone like a weapon and has a sharp enough tongue to rival any blade. (He also unleashes insults at the middling ', 'Hamlet', ' actor — Adrian Der Gregorian, a great actor parodically playing the part as a ""misunderstood,"" artsy bro at a poetry slam. If you know, you know.)', 'But lest that first scene make you think Cyrano is all anger, he divulges his love for the beautiful, intelligent Roxane (Evelyn Miller) to a friend five minutes later. Suddenly, this self-assured showstopper in leather is as flustered and giddy as a schoolboy with a crush.\xa0Cyrano can be a tough protagonist to root for, with his self-destructive pride, lofty way of talking, and constant deception, but the versatile McAvoy brings unexpected humility and humor to the character.', ""And you can't help but be enamored by the balcony scene toward the end of Act 1, the show's most arresting sequence. Cyrano feeds dialogue to Christian (a sweet Eben Figueiredo) to woo Roxane, but inadvertantly ends up speaking for Christian himself under cover of darkness. With Roxane's back turned, Cyrano delivers his love confession, a seductive monologue, straight to the audience. No matter how far you're sitting from the stage, McAvoy makes the moment feel truly intimate, an admirable feat in an 897-seat theatre. Ultimately, the only flaw in McAvoy's casting is that it's difficult to imagine him wanting for admirers, especially since he doesn't wear the honking prosthetic nose that supposedly makes him ugly.\xa0(It's worth mentioning here that Lloyd also gives Cyrano and Christian some serious homoerotic chemistry, creating a true love triangle.)"", ""Although McAvoy's presence commands constant attention at every turn, don't overlook Miller, who gives a quietly strong performance as Roxane and makes us think twice about our endearment to Cyrano. She especially shines in Act 2 — which discards much of the humor of Act 1 and digs into tragedy — with a speech decrying both Cyrano and Christian for objectifying her beauty and overlooking her intelligence. To both Crimp's and Miller's credit, the monologue doesn't feel preachy, but righteous. Cyrano wields his anger like a battering ram, bowling over everyone in sight, but Roxane wields hers like a dagger, striking pointedly at the heartstrings."", 'Cyrano de Bergerac', '\xa0is at the BAM Harvey Theater through May 22.

There is no flattening of nuance or emotion, as can often happen when properties are given the operatic treatment.\xa0', 'This is likely thanks in large part to Nottage ― who has adapted her own text for the new libretto ― as well as her partnership with composer Ricky Ian Gordon, director Bartlett Sher, costume designer Catherine Zuber, and choreographer Dianne McIntyre, in bringing the story to life.', 'Intimate Apparel', ' follows Esther Mills (Kearstin Piper Brown), a Black seamstress on the verge of becoming an ""old maid"" in 1905 Manhattan. Esther dreams of opening her own beauty parlor that caters to other Black women and starting a loving family, and the plot kicks into high gear when she begins a written correspondence with George Armstrong (Justin Austin), a Caribbean man working on the Panama Canal.\xa0', ""Esther is illiterate and turns to her wealthiest patron, Mrs. Van Buren (Naomi Louisa O'Connell), to decipher and respond to each loving missive. What is merely a game for Van Buren fills Esther with hope that she will find a love to let her escape her doldrums. After George proposes marriage, Esther accepts, sight unseen, despite warnings from her landlady Mrs. Dickson (Adrienne Danrich) that this peculiar arrangement will leave her dejected.\xa0"", ""True to that prophecy, upon finally meeting on their wedding day, Esther learns that Armstrong is not the gallant man of his letters, just as she is not the fair maiden of hers. From there, their collective dreams begin to unravel as their inability to accept each other's true selves takes its toll."", 'With ', 'Intimate Apparel', ', Nottage reveals a brutal critique of the limitations the world places on women as well as the way they contort themselves to fit a societal mold ― even when they have desires and plans of their own. Each woman within the play has a unique inner life that is impossible to fulfill without severe compromise.\xa0', ""We see this during landlady Mrs. Dickson's powerful warning to Esther, that she's forsaking love in favor of security. In her role as a woman who has seen both sides of love, Danrich pierces one's heart as Dickson when she shapes her lush voice into a near howl of anguish: Unlike Mrs. Dickson's mother, who worked her hands bloody, Mrs. Dickson has magnificent hands ― but nothing warm to hold on to."", ""Brown brings Esther's deepest yearnings to life with a warm soprano that continues to blossom, most particularly when she pleads for the love she deserves.

Sadie, who is mute to those around her but addresses the audience with a formidable grace, tells us she can raise the dead.

The third house belongs to a pair of aging sisters, one who constantly tends the hallowed ground (Lizan Mitchell) and another (Stephanie Berry) who vigorously, and often hilariously, tends only to herself.

In ', 'Out of Time', ', a National Asian American Theatre Company (NAATCO) and ', 'Public Theater', ' co-production, the transient nature of life is never far from mind. The play features five accomplished Asian American actors, each starring in a monologue by one of five Asian American playwrights.\xa0', 'At two and a half hours long in total, most of these monologues could have benefited from stricter editing, but ― memento mori: each performer is over 60 years old. Though time is the one thing we cannot replace, after listening to each character speak, I felt that their earned wisdom might spare me future pain.', 'That is the gist of ', 'Out of Time', '. These individual characters all wish to impart lessons as atonement for their failings. With the exception of Sam Chanse\'s ""Disturbance Specialist,"" they manage to avoid didacticism. Though one can even forgive this faux pas, as she has penned a scorching yet compassionate send-off for once-lauded elders who have tripped into the zeitgeist of cancellation vs. accountability.', 'In ""Disturbance Specialist,"" Natsuko Ohama plays Leonie, an unrepentant activist and educator who finds herself ""canceled"" after issuing an unfortunate tweet. She never presents context for what she said. Instead, Chanse illustrates the tragedy of a self-inflicted fall from grace. Ohama is thrilling as she waxes between defensiveness, descriptions of potential offenses, acknowledgment of harm, and finally, acceptance that there is no redemption for her.\xa0', 'Redemption also factors into the evening\'s two strongest entries ― Anna Ouyang Moench\'s ""My Documentary"" and Naomi Iizuka\'s ""Japanese Folk Song"" ― both of which could easily expand into evening-long works. In the former, Page Leong portrays an unnamed documentary filmmaker who connects the early death of her twin sister to a later loss in her life. As her character, Leong exudes the crisp remove of an impartial investigator, though her mask slips as she wanders toward the one thing she cannot control: love. The tragedy is that there is no way to redeem love after it is gone.', 'In ""Japanese Folk Song,"" Glenn Kubota renders Taki with the affable charm of an indulgent grandparent who manages to make griping fun. Taki has no occupation; he simply meanders through reveries. Eventually, he latches onto his loathing for the arbitrary chaos of jazz music. But in recalling his first wife\'s favorite song ― Thelonious Monk\'s ""Japanese Folk Song,"" which is based upon the Japanese folk song ""Kōjō no Tsuki"" ― he begins to hear the undergirding tune. This awakens Taki to his current reality, which was caused by a betrayal, but from which there is no escape.', 'Watching Kubota and Leong grapple with their personal hells in these beautifully crafted monologues is worth the price of admission on its own.\xa0', 'Mia Chung\'s ""Ball in the Air"" and Jaclyn Backhaus\'s ""Black Market Caviar"" are less captivating, though I admired their willingness to be weird and challenging. ""Ball"" features Mia Katigbak unleashing her unerring skill with a paddle ball. The trick, she reveals, is in her concentration. Faltering concentration becomes an analogy for what happens to her character, Ena, after she loses her composure. Though Katigbak is fully committed to the part, ""Ball in the Air"" feels too on the nose in connecting that point ― concentration vs. losing oneself ― to its conclusion.\xa0', 'Meanwhile, ""Black Market Caviar"" is framed as a video recorded by Carla as a glimpse into the future scarcity of certain goods.

Khoury accomplishes this by presenting the struggle between two small families as a proxy for their ruptured nation.', 'Kabul', "" opens with Taroon (Dario Ladani Sanchez), a former interpreter for the U.S. military, ambling restlessly about an apartment until the sound of someone at the door sends him hiding inside a closet. He relaxes after his sister Afiya (Marjan Neshat) signals that it is just her. Afiya cares for her brother, but it is clear that she and her husband, Jawid (Mattico David), are at their wits' end from the stress of hiding him from the Taliban within their two-room home."", ""Against Afiya's advice, Taroon plans to visit his wife, who has just given birth to their son, even though doing so will likely result in their entire family being killed.

For instance, Sanchez has been directed to make Taroon's demands that his desires be prioritized so rabidly intense that I began to wish\xa0the Taliban would actually get rid of him so his family could find peace. Because of his careless behavior and many tantrums, one forgets that he is supposed to be hiding."", ""The refusal to honor this conceit is matched by Neshat's unmodulated performance, which is so high-strung that it is difficult to differentiate between her moments of annoyance and loss of control.

But that's why we use social media, comedian Alex Edelman suggests: to see bad opinions from safely behind our own screens, where we can feel self-righteous for disagreeing without ever having to truly face most of the people spewing their venom. Unless, of course, you're Edelman, in which case you're met with anti-Semitic hate on Twitter, discover that the offenders are gathering in the next borough over, and decide to infiltrate the proverbial lions' den."", 'Literally, the den — Edelman vividly describes the living room that serves as White-Nationalists-of-Queens HQ, where a jigsaw puzzle sits outside the entrance and juice and pastries are splayed on tables near a folding-chair circle. Quaint and homey, if you ignore the nearby people griping about the ""erasure of white history from schools"" and Meghan Markle\'s admission into the British royal family. This contradiction, between what\'s inviting and entertaining yet seems like it shouldn\'t be, is similarly at the heart of\xa0', 'Just For Us', "", Edelman's latest comedy show that's returned to the "", 'Cherry Lane Theatre', ' after a Covid-prompted hiatus.', 'Before launching into the details of\xa0this white nationalist meeting where he almost curried his haters\' favor, Edelman kicks off with a flippant bit about how an ASL-fluent gorilla took the news of Robin Williams\'s passing, and the show only gets more off-kilter from there.

'Kristina Wong: Sweatshop Overlord' review - an important collective processing of the pandemic,"In the beginning of the show ', 'Kristina Wong: Sweatshop Overlord', ',\xa0Wong gives the audience a trigger warning: ""The show takes place in the pandemic."" Said by almost any other artist at this point, that statement might be met with an internal groan. After all, we\'re still living in the pandemic and still deeply traumatized by the past 20 months, what insight can possibly be gained right now? But Wong\'s delightful and deeply moving one-person show at ', 'New York Theatre Workshop', ' may be just what we all need to start processing the events of the past year.', 'This is because ', 'Sweatshop Overlord', "" is not just a compendium of all that was traumatic about the past 20 months. It is more specific and compelling than that. Using her off-kilter and tongue-in-cheek humor, Wong describes how she started a virtual sewing circle with women from all around the country, to make free masks for people who needed them. And it's an indication of Wong's sense of humor that the group name, Auntie Sewing Squad, also forms the acronym ASS.\xa0"", 'Yet despite the light-hearted name, there is a deep importance to what ASS were doing, using what is traditionally relegated and diminished as women\'s work to save the lives of strangers. What started off as a hobby to get through the early days of the pandemic became, as Wong says, a ""shadow FEMA,"" providing masks, and even hand sanitizer, to healthcare workers, Native American reservations, immigrant farmworkers, unhoused folks, ICE detainees, Black Lives Matter protesters, and the many other marginalized groups overlooked and ignored by the American government.', 'The women in (what Wong cheekily calls) her sweatshop, have sewn 350,000 masks (full disclosure: ', 'I wrote about the Auntie Sewing Squad last year', ""). But this isn't one of those feel-good stories about how regular people persevered despite the failures of American society, like those stories about strangers donating to people's medical bills on Kickstarter.\xa0"", 'The genius balance that Wong is able to achieve in ', 'Sweatshop Overlord', ' is her ability to highlight the feel-good, human interest aspect of the Auntie Sewing Squad with a deep indictment of American society. What kind of country, Wong exclaims, makes a circus out of billionaires flying off into space, yet is unable to provide its healthcare workers and the most vulnerable among us with life-saving PPE? ""Is America a banana republic disguised as a democracy?"" asks Wong. The audience at New York Theatre Workshop, utterly invested in Wong\'s story, answered with a resounding yes at the night I attended the show.\xa0', 'That is not to say that ', 'Sweatshop Overlord', ""\xa0is a bummer (it's more like "", 'Full Frontal with Samantha Bee', '\xa0rather than ', '60 Minutes', '). The set is cuddly and ', 'Sesame Street', ""-esque, with a Hello Kitty Sewing Machine at its center and oversized sewing supplies made of felt (Junghyun Georgia Lee designed the set). Lighting designer Amith Chandrashaker skillfully transitions between the different moods of the show. And director Chay Yew makes sure that Wong's spitfire humor lands with the audience, while allowing for moments of stillness and heart. The thrust staging, with the audiences on three sides, also makes the show feel more intimate and inviting."", ""Wong is an energetic and engaging performer, with an everywoman appeal (no small feat considering that, as Wong points out, an Asian face has been considered foreign and dangerous during this pandemic). When Wong describes how going outside at the height of the pandemic in 2020 felt like going into battle, and Wong is crawling on her forearms and knees as she's saying this, the audience understands exactly what she felt. We may not have crawled on our stomach to go to the Post Office, but putting on our masks and gloves to go outside then did feel like going into a war.\xa0"", ""There has been an overwhelming sense, as society has started to reopen again, that we are all moving too fast to put the pandemic behind us. We haven't had the time to process, mourn, and take stock of who we have become. "", 'Sweatshop Overlord', '\xa0is theater at its best and most essential.

"'The Visitor' review - a well-intentioned, yet out-of-touch musical","There has been much drama around\xa0', 'The Visitor', ',\xa0', 'the new Tom Kitt, Brian Yorkey, and Kwame Kwei-Armah musical. The show\'s opening last year was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then when it was scheduled to return this fall, the first two preview performances of the musical were postponed to, per the Public\'s statement, ""accommodate for more time for the company to address questions about race, representation, and identity."" Then one of ', 'The Visitor', ""'s stars, Tony winner Ari'el Stachel, departed the musical. Why would Stachel, who had been part of the musical's development process for six years, leave it right before opening night?\xa0"", 'There is a possible answer, and it points to the fundamental flaw in ', 'The Visitor', ' itself.\xa0', 'The Visitor,\xa0', ""based on the 2007 film of the same name, follows college professor Walter, who is white and suffering from grief at the death of his wife. Through chance, he meets Syrian refugee Tarek, who is at risk of being deported. Through Walter's attempt to keep Tarek in America, Walter learns how to connect with other human beings again.\xa0"", 'When ', 'The Visitor', ' was released in 2007, it was the rare attempt to humanize Muslims in the eyes of Americans, during a time when Muslims were demonized in the media, while the American military pillaged Afghanistan and Iraq. And because it was 2007, it was common to have a white narrator be the eyes for the audience, to translate this ""foreign"" world of immigration, political asylum, and ICE custody to them.\xa0', 'In 2021, the same story with the same white narrator has turned this entreaty for humanity into a white savior narrative that, while well-intentioned, is woefully out of touch.\xa0', ""The musical opens with Walter, played by Emmy winner David Hyde Pierce, going through the motions while teaching. Walter then meets Tarek (played by Ahmad Maksoud, who was Statchel's understudy), Tarek's girlfriend Zainab, a refugee from Senegal (Alysha Deslorieux), and Tarek's mother Mouna (Jacqueline Antaramian). Each of the immigrant characters have a compelling narrative about why they came to America, what happened in their homeland, and how much they've suffered because of America's inhumane immigration system. Yet you won't find much from them in terms of character development."", ""Instead, the focus is on Walter and his interiority, how Tarek being imprisoned by ICE has opened Walter's eyes to the rot and hypocrisy of America. The people of color in the story are constrained to being side characters, nobly suffering. While Walter is given a career and character motivations, by contrast, Tarek is only given broad strokes of a characterization: He loves Zainab and plays the drums. But not much is given about what his dreams are, how he met Zainab, why he needs to play music. Walter is given a character arc while Tarek, who is facing deportation back to Syria, is constrained to nobly suffering.\xa0"", 'Sure, one man learned about U.S. immigration law and was woken up by it, but another man is about to lose his home and will be sent back to a war-ravaged country. The stakes are markedly different and it is ', 'The Visitor', ""'s fatal flaw that it tries to even place them on an equal playing field."", ""This is not the fault of the actors. Pierce is sensitive and likeable as Walter, his sad eyes truly pierce your soul. It is a testament to Pierce's likability that his ignorance about the injustice of the American immigration system comes off as naive instead of, well, privileged.\xa0"", ""Maksoud portrays Tarek with a surface level of depth: Tarek's scenes in ICE detention are played with resignation, lacking any emotional punch. But considering that Maksoud was the understudy, perhaps his performance will feel more lived-in with time."", 'The women of the cast are the ones who truly shine. A highlight of the show is their affecting duet ""Lady Liberty,"" with lyrics like ""You say give me your tired, your poor. Well we\'ve got more. They knock, but you\'re not at the door,"" with equal parts tenuous hope and bitter cynicism. \u200b\u200bAs portrayed by Antaramian and Deslorieux, with a steel spine and intelligence, these women are not simple victims. They are survivors.\xa0', 'But it is notable that none of the immigrant characters in the story are ever truly angry at the injustice of their circumstances. Instead it is Walter who is allowed to be angry, in his 11 o\'clock number where he sings out in a rallying cry: ""We must find our better angels. And our country\'s stolen soul. And remember where we came from. And make what\'s broken whole.""', 'Who is the ""we"" here? Because for many immigrants, Black people, and people of color, America\'s better angels never existed.\xa0', 'The Visitor\xa0', ""expects white rage and white awareness to be worth applauding. But we've gone past the time when awareness and rage is a milestone. The U.S. has kept migrant children in cages, Syrian refugees drowned at sea trying to escape war: The time has passed for raising awareness. It is time to take that rage and put it into action.\xa0"", 'That is not to say ', 'The Visitor', "" needs to include a call-to-action for fixing America's broken immigration system. But the musical's narrow focus just shows how ill equipped it is for meeting the current moment.\xa0"", 'The Visitor', ' ends with Walter sitting in an empty apartment, his new friends having left.

'Winnie the Pooh' review — an hour of bountiful joy accessible to all,"There are many ways that a live-action production of Disney's "", 'Winnie the Pooh', ' could have gone awry. Thankfully, the newly opened Off-Broadway musical adaptation of ', 'Pooh', "" has eschewed a theme park approach and focused instead on the story's folksy charm."", 'Anyone who grew up reading the A.A. Milne books or watching the Sherman Brothers-scored movies knows that there is not much of a plot to ', 'Pooh', '. The original stories follow a silly stuffed bear who comes to life and goes on adventures while waiting for his human friend, Christopher Robin, to return from school. Usually those exploits involve securing honey, which Pooh loves as much as a certain cartoon mouse does cheese.', 'Rather than expand that concept into an overly long extravaganza that comments on the avaricious nature of men, this Rockefeller Production-designed show respects its source material and allows the action to unfold almost exactly as it does on the page.\xa0', ""For audiences, that means a manageable 65-minute-long romp with Pooh and his anthropomorphized friends as they enjoy what makes each of the four seasons enjoyable: the blusteriness of autumn and rescuing Piglet from a runaway kite; befriending a snow-lady in a winter wonderland; ruining Rabbit's vegetable garden while practicing bouncing with Tigger and Kanga; and of course, rescuing Pooh from a honey tree. Though Christopher Robin makes a brief appearance at the top of the show and conclusion, as in "", 'Toy Story', ', here the toys are the thing.', 'Upon entering the newly renamed Hundred Acre Wood Theatre at ', 'Theatre Row', "", audiences are met with a gorgeous set which David Goldstein has designed to evoke the illustrative magic of Milne's original artwork. The overall effect is that one actually feels as if they are standing within the world of Pooh's picture books.\xa0"", ""Soon, Jake Bazel saunters onstage with a life-size puppet of our leading character attached to his front. Bazel plays Pooh with a bemused grin while leaning into his clueless though amiably selfish ways. He manages this feat without reducing Pooh to a narcissistic rapscallion, though at times ― like Kristy Moon's Piglet and Roo and Kristina Dizon's Kanga ― he adds on twee affectations that appear to comment on the potentially saccharine nature of the material, rather than simply allowing the action to unfurl. Perhaps the three gifted performers were simply pushing childlike ardor harder than was necessary for the 10 a.m.\xa0performance I attended."", ""What rights\xa0the sentimental balance of the show is Emmanuel Elpenord's show-stealing comedy as a knowingly ho-hum Eeyore, smart-alecky Owl, and exasperated Rabbit. Elpenord's characterizations are wry without ever being arch, and wink\xa0just enough at the adults in the audience to invite them into the jokes as well. He is joined by Chris Palmieri's artfully scatterbrained Tigger who all but bounces away with every scene he appears in.\xa0"", ""Elpenord and Palmieri also show the greatest level of detailed puppetry and physical theatre; they enter and exit each scene with the same commitment to character whether they are embodying butterflies, snowflakes, or a named character. Additionally, their foot and hand work are so precise that one starts to believe that Matthew Lish's wonderfully crafted puppets have actually come to life."", ""Pooh is decidedly gentle entertainment. Much like Rockefeller's\xa0other equally loving production,\xa0"", 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar Show,', '\xa0this show feels as if it has been specifically designed so that audiences of all stimulation levels can comfortably attend. Indeed, at the performance I attended, there were adults with advanced autism waving their hands with glee as well as rambunctious toddlers and tykes, some of whom were undoubtedly enjoying their first live-theatre experience.\xa0', 'I am unashamed to admit that observing them revel in the beauty of this production, content in the knowledge that they were safe to do so, reduced me to tears.\xa0', 'It was only a matter of time before Disney gave ', 'Pooh', "" the same theatrical translation as its other intellectual properties; that's why I'm thrilled that the behemoth trusted this production team to do so with gentle care rather than exaggerated flash. Though there is much talk about access to theatre around racial lines, it is rare to see that same consideration given to those with sensory limitations.

The only problem is the show is entirely too much for such a small venue. That theme of too much, or doing the most with the least, is an ever-present issue that Out of the Box Theatrics never resolves in the remount of its 2019 production.\xa0', 'But what does ""too much"" mean? Well, ', 'Baby', ' follows three couples ― college sweethearts on the cusp of adulting, two established 30-year-olds, and an older couple ― as they all process surprise pregnancies. Rather than focus on one couple, the show tries to be all things to its six principal characters, so that what one gets is more of an underdeveloped mini-series than a musical. This manifests as a 2-hour-and-40-minute-long beast that, regardless of how well directed and performed it is, overstays its welcome by at least 50 minutes.', ""During a pre-show announcement, the production's director and choroegrapher Ethan Paulini\xa0revealed that his team worked with the show's original creators ― composer David Shire,\xa0lyricist Richard Maltby, Jr.,\xa0and book writer Sybil Pearson\xa0― to update the show. Indeed, Maltby, who served as the original 1983 Broadway production's director, is credited as a directing and writing consultant.\xa0"", 'Their updates include transforming the college coupling of Lizzie (Liz Flemming) and Danny (Johnny Link) into a legally blind and partially deaf duo, as well as the formerly heterosexual 30-year-olds into a lesbian couple ― Pam (Danielle Summons) and Nicki (Jamila Sabares-Klemm).

This is in place of a monitored annual review presided over by a team of professionals so that ― regardless of what may occur during this session ― the predetermined conclusion is that John is unfit to return to society.', 'Audiences divine this over the course of the 90-minute show while attempting to ascertain whether what is happening is real, a hallucination, or a memory. That Walsh chooses not to specify this from the get-go could be part of the fun. Many people in the audience the night I attended found the experience titillating.\xa0', ""I felt that because so much work was put into obfuscating where the story was going ― and because I figured out what was occurring too quickly ― there was not enough left over to hold my attention. It's not that the actors were ever less than fully engaged; indeed, Gleeson's extended bouts of yelling were truly affecting. But after being walloped over the head with bursts of temper tantrums, loud noises, light effects, random acts of unreasonable violence, and extreme silence, I found myself yearning for greater nuance. Imagine someone yelling the first half of a sentence at you and then whispering the latter part with gravitas. That sounds potentially enthralling on the surface, until you experience said effect play itself out repeatedly as the conflict of extremes did here. Far from exhilarating, I came away feeling detached and dehumanized."", 'A major issue is the manner in which ', ""Medicine's"", "" puzzle is unraveled.

One is not offered solid footing in "", 'Medicine', ' until a full recording reveals the full dishonest truth ― that these sessions were more pageantry than an opportunity for redemption ― and we are left staring at the face of our leading man as the light of dawn washes across the stage.', 'One could say that in directing this story, Walsh wants audiences to understand how mental unwellness feels. Where he failed, for me, was in providing the nuance of an ordinary world in which John had a reason to believe that he was in control and should be released from his asylum. Instead, as rendered by Gleeson, he is nebbish and lacks assertive drive over his own story from the start.\xa0', ""A reasonable person might look at what John is subjected to and ascertain that the asylum is willfully invalidating any sense of autonomy that he might have so that he agrees to continue paying them to control him; or that Walsh is artfully presenting the way that some mental health agencies operate so as to retain authority over their charges. That's a solid perspective when one considers that abuse does exist and is often unmonitored if not ignored within the mental healthcare industry. \xa0But, rather than engage with this critique directly, Walsh focuses on light shows, actors in strange costumes, and lip-synching to audio recordings that lack context.\xa0"", ""As one of the actors who has been hired to convince John that he should remain within the asylum's care, Mary #1 (Clare Barrett) exhibits a swaggering narcissism that one might expect from a person with borderline personality disorder. Contrasted with meek Mary #2 (Aoife Duffin) who feels sorry for John but fails to mount an adequate defense of her convictions, I kept wondering how it might look were Mary #1 exposed to the same experience.\xa0"", 'Watching the foregone conclusion of someone who never had a chance get beat up by the world holds limited appeal.

The result is a hilarious and relatable adaptation for those of us nervously readjusting back to in-person socializing.\xa0"", ""Sarah Rose Kearns's script keeps Austen's period dialogue, so the staging, under direction by Eric Tucker, achieves the comic effect.

‘Semblance’ at New York Theatre Workshop raises more questions than it answers,"Black women are not a monolith. Our skin tones range from coffee, light and sweet, to dark rich licorice. We enjoy different genres of music, eat a variety of cuisines, journey down a host of career paths, and have original styles of dress. And still, the world constantly lumps us all together as if we are one, all living the same experience.

Unlike Shakespeare's better comedies, the characters in "", 'Merry Wives', "" are broadly drawn. The relationships are also underdeveloped, so when conflict occurs, there's little emotional investment in those moments on the part of the audience.

Armand and Watson are magnetic as the merry wives, and the play would have been stronger with more scenes between them. This was also an opportunity to make Anne Page (Abena) something other than an object to be won and married off.', ""Even though she does not add any new scenes to Shakespeare's play, Bioh does improve upon it and gives it a contemporary urgency. In Bioh's version, Anne's lover Fenton is now a woman (Boateng), a smart decision that adds an undercurrent of homophobia to the Page family's disapproval of Fenton. It's a bitter note to an otherwise frothy play. Because if you're going to adapt Shakespeare, you might as well expand upon and improve upon the material."", 'Then, when the characters convene in the woods for the coda of the play, Mama Quickly\'s original monologue is completely replaced by a Bioh-penned prayer: ""For our hues and lives matter, full stop.

"Review of Paris, written by Eboni Booth, at Atlantic Theater Company","Paris', ', the new work by emerging playwright ', 'Eboni Booth', ', has nothing to do with the City of Light. This slice-of-life drama is set in Paris, Vermont, a city of blight, where a group of superstore warehouse employees, circa 1995, struggle through their long shifts before heading to a second job, or to the bar, or disappearing altogether. The play, staged by the ', 'Atlantic Theater Company', ' at ', 'Atlantic Stage 2', ', percolates at a slow and even pace, under the sure direction of ', 'Knud Adams', ', as it establishes the plight of each of its seven characters. Which is not to say that everything is spelled out for the audience. Rather, the most effective moments are those with pieces missing, or where a line of brutish dialogue is met with only a simmering silence.', 'Gar (', 'Eddie K. Robinson', "") is the manager of the Paris outlet of Berry's, a Walmart-like retailer, but with a sketchier payroll department. Emmie ("", 'Jules Latimer', "") is his newest employee and, like him, a person of color. But unlike Gar, Emmie's face is deeply bruised and she seemingly has had some teeth knocked out. A fall on the ice? A fall on the ice after several vodkas? Or some other reason entirely? The absence of an explanation lends an air of mystery to newcomer Latimer's solid, understated performance. Gar, meanwhile, has secrets of his own, along with a gambling compulsion, mood swings, and the kind of collegial sense of humor that borders on harassment. Robinson's edgy performance results in a likable character that one nonetheless does not feel sorry for after he meets a worrisome fate."", ""Emmie's colleagues are all Caucasian and harbor prejudice in their bones to various degrees.

Review of Frankenstein at Classic Stage Company,"Though created 80 years apart, ', 'Mary Shelley', ""'s "", 'Frankenstein', ' ', 'and ', 'Bram Stoker', ""'s "", 'Dracula', ' ', 'are pop-cultural close cousins.

', 'Rob Morrison', ' is the one-man chorus. He narrates, strums a few different string instruments that, if not exactly furthering the action, sets a mood, and voices a variety of doomed to be strangled characters. ', 'Stephanie Berry', ' portrays The Creature and if it is at first surprising that an African American woman is inhabiting the role, one realizes soon enough that when it comes to portraying the undead, any casting is against type.', ""Rather than forging any sort of contemporary sociological statement, the creative team has opted to let Shelley's work speak for itself. That is, once it learns to speak. The first quarter of the 80 minute one-act is primarily concerned with the creature coming to life, learning the joys and dangers of the natural world and very slowly gaining language skills. Thus, Berry does a lot of grunting and gesticulating. One clever moment successfully transforms the monster's moans into an understanding of music, but it is otherwise a long slog."", 'Once the creature has grasped English, words spill forth in full Victorian splendor. Bernays has picked the meatiest swaths of Shelley\'s novel and serves them up in heightened language, primarily in narrative passages spoken directly to the audience. ""I left the woods in the deep decay of autumn and trudged into the bare bones of winter, the earth beneath me hard as my heart."" The storytelling is pleasing to the ear yet, as staged, the misery of both the monster and the monster builder is undercut by a lack of theatricality and seemingly intentional deadpan manner. Not helping matters, the essence of Dr. Victor Frankenstein is scattered. While it makes good dramatic sense to have Berry inhabit both creature and creator, the doctor is initially portrayed by Morrison. When Berry suddenly takes over the representation, it is more confusing than enlightening.', 'John Doyle, the fine musical director who is bringing ', 'Assassins', ' ', 'to CSC in April, pitches in as scenic designer. His sparse offerings include a large table that works well as the slab upon which the brute takes its first breaths, but then mostly just gets in the way.

Review of Dracula at Classic Stage Company,"Over the past few years, playwright ', 'Kate Hamill', ' has created something of a cottage industry, writing and acting in feminist stage adaptations of novels like ', 'Pride & Prejudice', ' and ', 'Little Women', '. But, until now, she had denied herself the true pleasure of penning a revenge fantasy. Her ', 'Dracula', ', teeming with powerful women and playing in repertory at the ', 'Classic Stage Company', ""'s Lynn F. Angelson Theater, alongside a much more by the book adaptation of "", 'Frankenstein', ' ', 'by ', 'Tristan Bernays', ', is biting in every sense of the word, a powerful tale of the overpowering.', ""Hamill's script operates on several different planes. On one level, it is possible that the whole grisly vampire story is the delusional dream of a madwoman with daddy issues named Rensfield. Locked in an insane asylum, dressed in tatters and giggling like a loon, more often than not she is lurking in the shadows as the narrative unfolds. The meta beauty of this conceit is that Rensfield is played by the playwright. Hamill's delight in being physically surrounded by the work that literally did come from her own mind is palpable and fuels her loose and joyful performance."", ""The play is also an homage to 1930's movie melodramas. Adam Honoré's lighting design is all sidelights, lanterns and shadows and, as directed by "", 'Sarna Lapine', ', the heroines move with cinematic eloquence while ', 'Matthew Saldivar', ', as the hapless head of the asylum, Doctor Seward, gallops around, tossing off loaded bits of intentionally corny dialog like, ""Such stimulation is bad for her condition.""', 'But, most importantly, this ', 'Dracula ', 'is a corrective in overcoming the gothic tropes of damsels in distress and villains who wear evil on their sleeve. We know the dynamic has shifted early on as Count Dracula (a suave ', 'Matthew Amendt', ') looks up to a bright sky and proclaims, ""What a beautiful sunny day."" Also, crosses have no effect on him, his mouth is fang-free and his slight Transylvanian accent smacks of wealthy European executive. He is an apparent Everyman who can, parasitically, control those who seek him out. The lessons, as the real world too clearly reflects, are that outward appearances of dangerous men are deceptive, and that ""all men could turn dangerous if given too much power.""', 'The women who do battle with the Count are all strong, smart and beautiful. Lucy (', 'Jamie Ann Romero', ') draws parallels between succumbing to Dracula and succumbing to her potential fate as a housewife, ominously bemoaning that women cannot ""stay mad young creatures - forever."" Mina (', 'Kelley Curran', ') the pregnant wife of the once bitten, twice as insufferable Jonathan (', 'Michael Crane', "") channels her inner vampire killer once she learns what's at stake and Doctor Van Helsing ("", 'Jessica Frances Dukes', ', fierce, fast and furious) leads the way despite her outsider status.

Review of The Young Man from Atlanta at Signature Theatre,"Horton Foote', ""'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play, "", 'The Young Man from Atlanta', ', is lovingly brought to life again by Signature Theatre at Pershing Square Signature Center. Directed with respectful humor by ', 'Michael Wilson', ', the play immerses us in the quietly desperate lives of Will and Lily Dale Kidder (', 'Aidan Quinn', ' and ', 'Kristine Nielsen', "") of 1950 Houston Texas. Six months ago the Kidder's only son, Bill, walked into a lake and drowned. Will accepts that his son committed suicide but Lily Dale wants to believe it was an accident. On top of this tragedy Will was just fired from the company he built and dedicated 25 years to. A proud man Will refuses the three months notice Southern Wholesale Grocery gives him, even though he recently spent all their savings building a gorgeous modern home to help his wife and himself get over the death of their son."", ""Bill was living in Atlanta when he died. We learn that his roommate, Randy, (never appears in the play), came to Houston for the funeral and made fast friends with Bill's mother, Lily Dale, against Will's instructions. Lily Dale is comforted by Randy and the affection he had for her son. Will doesn't trust him."", 'All except the opening scene of the play takes place in the pastel living room of the Kidder\'s new home. Their life is typically mid-century American. So typical that the Kidders don\'t want to know that their son was homosexual. The love that dare not speak its name, is never spoken, never named by the couple. As Will explains to Lily Dale, ""...there are things I\'d have to ask him (Randy) and I don\'t want to know...There was a Bill I knew and a Bill you knew and that\'s the only Bill I care to know about."" Lily Dale doesn\'t want to know either.

In response to all of the confusions and disappointments Lily Dale finds in people she loves she asks, ""Who are we to believe, Daddy?""', 'The Young Man from Atlanta', "" is ingeniously written. It is old fashioned in style and characterization and that is perfect. It lets us into private moments with a couple that are unaware of their political positions in life.

Tasked with portraying a high-powered attorney who is not above committing a violent assault when tanked up on tequila, Kirkland underplays the part to mixed effect. And as playwright, this former trial attorney loads the script with legalese and misdirection in the first act, before unloading a devastating lesson on the misunderstanding and withholding of evidence in the second. Despite the play's punny title, this is no courtroom farce.

Review of Sing Street at New York Theatre Workshop,"PLEASE NOTE: This is a review of the Off-Broadway world premiere of\xa0', 'Sing Street\xa0', 'at New York Theatre Workshop.', 'The moral of ', 'Sing Street', "", as taught by a group of moody teenagers and put-upon adults, is that music, even 1980's pop music, can transform a boy into a man, especially when aided by the love of a pretty girl and the support of an older brother. This new musical, receiving its world premiere at "", 'New York Theatre Workshop', ', is a distillation of the 2016 semi-autobiographical film by ', 'John Carney', ' about his coming of age in Dublin and then his getting the hell out. Those who arrive at the show with the movie still in mind will find Carney\'s songs beautifully refreshed, with samplings of period hits like Depeche Mode\'s ""Just Can\'t Get Enough"" and Duran Duran\'s ""Rio"" providing counterpoint. But they will also find less chemistry between the two love interests and less depth to the supporting characters. Those who have never seen the film can expect loose strings and six-strings, rousing chorus numbers, some charming ballads and a tale that veers between silly and sad, violent and soft.', 'With a book by ', 'Enda Walsh', "" (Carney's collaborator on their Broadway hit, "", 'Once', '), and additional music and lyrics by ', 'Gary Clark', ', ', 'Sing Street', ' tracks a rough year for Conor (', ""Brenock O'Connor"", "") as his family's finances force him from a posh private academy into the free but strict Synge Street, a Catholic school that comes complete with a bully named Barry ("", 'Johnny Newcomb', '), an equally brutish principal, Brother Baxter (', 'Martin Moran', '), and a half dozen lads who, fortunately, are skilled guitarists, keyboard players and drummers. Conor takes after his brother, Brendan (a sympathetic ', 'Gus Halper', '), in his love of rock-and-roll, but his passion takes on new urgency once he meets Raphina (', 'Zara Devlin', '), the mysterious, slightly older girl with ""dangerous eyes"" and a questionable habit of hanging around outside of a boys\' school. Conor impresses her with a lie, that he is a band singer, then goes about turning his class into a bona fide school of rock. With his parents on the verge of divorce, Baxter on the warpath and Dublin in general seeming to hold no future, Conor accomplishes what his brother never could: winning a girl and escaping to London. That\'s great for them, but awkward for veteran director ', 'Rebecca Taichman', ' who is left with staging the final number, ""Go Now,"" without her two leads.', ""The greatest joy of the film was watching Conor's evolution from innocent to self-assured.

Review of Evita at New York City Center,"The legacy and history of the Broadway genre is defined most by its divas: Broadway's brightest and most archetypal stars have been women. They are charismatic, larger than life, and have voices that bring crowds to their knees and to their feet. Moreover, they are immense cultural properties that hold a special place in the hearts of those they reach."", 'Both the titular character and source material of ', 'Evita', ' reflect this principle. Eva Perón, as a complex political figure, has endured as an international cultural icon, inspiring this very musical. Her career as an entertainer-turned-politician, with its engrossed public and cult of celebrity, was marked with as much controversy as glamour.', ""Perhaps it's for this reason that, in her effort to revitalize "", 'Evita', ' for contemporary audiences at ', 'New York City Center', ', ', 'Sammi Cannold', "" has us re-examine what we feel about the glitz, and the woman behind it. Cannold's heavily researched approach pervades in this new streamlined rendition. Cuts and transitions make for a trim, two-hour runtime that leaves no dull moments. At worst, it's in want of a little breathing room. Cannold's incisive truthfulness zeroes in on the uglier facets of Perón's story—behind her talent and sexual power lie trauma and victimization at a young age. Behind the champion of descamisados and women's suffrage was also the wife of Perón's oppressive regime."", 'All this culminates in a rendition perhaps a little darker than even the grand, emotional weight of the score is accustomed to. From the moment audiences enter the theatre, they see Perón\'s iconic white Dior dress: Recreated by Alejo Vietti, suspended above Jason Sherwood\'s piers of white roses. Like Evita\'s hands, they are a saintly, ethereal, almost virginal gesture. This same almost-monument is eviscerated in the end by the same ensemble that not long ago so sensationalized Evita; as her own mortality looms, and her vacillating legacies echoes to haunting chants of ""Perón"". The audience, watching a reduced Eva on her deathbed, with her younger counterpart in a fetal position nearby, cannot help but wonder: Are we complicit?', ""Cannold's storytelling is complemented by all her collaborators, and a satisfyingly Latin-dominant cast. Evita's younger self is delegated to a separate actress: "", 'Maia Reficco', ""'s supple, poppy vocals as Young Eva deftly cycle "", 'Andrew Lloyd Webber', ""'s challenging score, but without much depth of character. However, despite an early transition to "", 'Solea Pfeiffer', ""'s stellar Eva, Reficco's presence throughout the rest of the show as a haunting, introspective shadow of Eva's past is no less potent. "", 'Jason Gotay', ""'s Che is fiercely sung, but lacking the gravitas and grit of former interpreters.

Review of Tony Kushner's A Bright Room Called Day at the Public Theater,"A Bright Room Called Day', ', now at the ', 'Public Theater', ', first breathed life back in 1985.\xa0We know this because playwright\xa0', 'Tony Kushner', ' appears as a character in the story about 10 minutes in and tells us.\xa0Mind you, he is not identified as Kushner. He is not named anywhere except the program. He is Xillah (', 'Jonathan Hadary', '), and presents himself as the author in a quandary.\xa0This is the play he wrote 34 years ago. It never worked until Trump was elected - and now everyone wants to produce it, but it needs an upgrade.\xa0He brings with him another character Zillah (', 'Crystal Lucas-Perry', '). While Xillah is located in our present, Zillah is located in the present of the writing of the original play - 1985.\xa0Xillah is playing fast and loose with time - but he can do that because he is the writer.\xa0The rest of us are merely along for the ride - and it will be a bumpy one.', 'The story covers the events in Berlin from January 1, 1932, to November 1933.\xa0Specifically, the exact months during which Hitler came into power, dismantling the German democracy, anointing himself supreme leader, and building the first concentration camp. Agnes Eggling (', 'Nikki M.

Racism, homophobia, the disregard for protocol, betrayal of foreign allegiances, and the demand for loyalty - these are chilling and not lost on any of us.\xa0Kushner, however, insists on driving the points home using Xillah and Zillah\'s sidebar conversations. These are labeled ""Interruptions"" in the script and become the didactic portions of the play.\xa0So dense that they bring the show to a slow halt.\xa0Over and over again.', 'The story is clear enough.\xa0As Germany begins to crumble, we watch the safety net unravel, bit by bit. Political parties are outlawed. People are taken away never to be seen again.\xa0Food is scarce. The powers are closing in on anyone not toeing the line.\xa0The life options soon become either leave the country (find the holes in the borders) and end your life as you know it, or end your life - period. Agnes is frozen in place and tormented by her personal nightmare, the character of Die Älte (', 'Estelle Parsons', "") who is part ghost, part menace, part prophesier.\xa0And let's not forget that short visit by the Devil ("", 'Mark Margolis', ""). Agnes becomes the iconic person in the crowd who does not salute Hitler.\xa0She grips her purse with both hands and tries to wish the evil away.\xa0She cannot, however.

Review of Lincoln Center Theater's LCT3 production of In the Green,"Being a kid in medieval Germany was no day at the beach, especially if you were Hildegard von Bingen. The youngest among 10 siblings, her parents sacrificed her to the Catholic Church when she was eight, and she spent the next 30 years locked away in a dark cell. She would emerge, circa 1136, to become a devout nun as well as a gifted writer, composer, and botanist who also performed exorcisms and had Godly visions. Nearly 900 years later she was declared a saint. Perhaps sensing that Hildegard would not be the easiest human with which to identify, playwright, actor and songwriter ', 'Grace McLean', ', in her new musical ', 'In the Green', "", at Lincoln Center Theater's "", 'Claire Tow Theater', "", turns the tale inward. Focusing on those three decades removed from society, McLean, utilizing enrapturing orchestral techniques, poetics and a giant prop eyeball, deconstructs the girl's life, breaking her into pieces for our examination."", 'As directed by ', 'Lee Sunday Evans', ', Hildegard is portrayed simultaneously by three different actors (', 'Rachael Duddy', ' clutching that eyeball, ', 'Ashley Pérez Flanagan', ' holding a pair of wooden lips, and ', 'Hannah Whitney', "" operating a large puppet hand).

And if a trio of performers singing as one seems like a suddenly familiar theatrical gambit, don't worry. This is no clone of "", 'The Cher Show', ""; it's the unveiling of a shared soul. Singing in harmony or taking turns with solos, the women demonstrate how Hildegard didn't so much grow up as grow down. When you are in a prison there is not much to do but dig, so shovel they do, both literally and metaphorically, unearthing a hole in the stage floor while struggling to become a whole woman. This hole/whole pairing is just one example of the spiritual wordplay at work. As the evening progresses, McLean displays the light within enlightenment and finds the dead in dedication, while exploring the many ways a woman conceptualizes her own body."", 'Hildegard is not alone with her selves in the cell, there is also Jutta (McLean) an older woman who had voluntarily sentenced herself to solitude and who became Hildegard\'s mentor. Her lessons generally revolve around the idea that being gone is the best way of being here. Or as she puts it, ""You have nothing to lose if everything\'s gone/When life is darkness, death is dawn/Life is better in death."" McLean\'s singing style is captivating and she elevates her performance with a nifty bit of technology. Often letting loose with a stream of utterances or other haunting mouth noises, she is wired up with a device that allows her to instantly record and play the tones over and over in a loop, providing an eerie and appropriately lonely sounding self-accompaniment.

The Red Letter Plays: In The Blood,"Review by ', 'Stanford Friedman', ' September 18, 2017', ""A few years prior to winning a Pulitzer for Topdog/Underdog, Suzan-Lori Parks had the idea to write a play inspired by Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter. And since plays often have minds of their own, that play turned out to be two plays: F**king A and In the Blood. Now, the Signature Theatre has brought these pieces together under the same roof, giving us two different Hesters and a world of grief."", ""The premise of In the Blood is simple enough: a single mother, with five children from five different men, slowly combusts as society judges her, and each of the fathers deny her any sense of love or dignity, let alone money for food. Hawthorne's influence is there to be sure, but Ms. Parks and her director, Sarah Benson, have drawn on a vast array of influences to create this captivating revival. A Greek chorus of naysayers open and close the play, marking the work as a tragedy. There are moments of playfulness that feel like 1960's improvisational theater, sexually frank monologues that would be at home in the 1980s, a clear feminist political agenda as authority figures press this Hester (Saycon Sengbloh) to a medical full stop of her fertility and, conversely, a touch of musical comedy as Hester, for a brief and shining moment, finds a likely husband and the couple break out in a song and dance number that Rodgers & Hammerstein would have approved."", 'There is also a healthy dose of absurdity. We meet all five of Hester\'s young kids, with the same actors then portraying the children\'s own fathers, or the women that led Hester to their fathers. There\'s two-year old Baby (Russell G. Jones), hilariously teething and being taught to crush soda cans with his feet. Then Mr. Jones goes from drooling to dry sanctimony as Reverend D., turning Baby\'s talent into harsh poetry as he threatens Hester, ""I\'ll crush you underfoot."" The eldest daughter, Bully (Jocelyn Bioh) is a caring child who can\'t sleep because her hands keep balling up into fists. Ms. Bioh later stops the show cold when she transforms into Hester\'s self-absorbed and wickedly perverse Welfare lady. Michael Braun as protective son Jabber and elusive father Chilli turns in a strong performance as does Ana Reeder as daughter Beauty and the streetwise Amiga Gringa. Only the usually great Frank Wood, who normally excels at neurotic villainy, has yet to find the proper vibe. His performance as middle child Trouble is middling, and he has yet to solve the complex role of the pill popping street doctor who once took advantage of Hester and now wants her fixed.', 'Ms. Sengbloh\'s Hester is a slowly ticking time bomb. At first, in control of her kids and providing what she can, it seems nothing can phase her. Then bit by bit, the clock runs down. There\'s a pain in the stomach and a feeling that ""a hand of fate"" is blocking out the sun (beautifully lit with the actor\'s hand indeed casting a shadow across her face). When the explosion finally comes, Ms. Sengbloh\'s finely measured performance reaches just the right bloody crescendo. Hawthorne\'s scarlet A shows up then, but white A\'s turn up earlier, written in chalk, the only letter that the illiterate Hester can write. In realism, that would be a stretch, but here it is a pervasive symbol of Hester\'s inability to move forward. It\'s also not lost on the audience that a word that rhymes with A is employed throughout, a crude synonym of the word hysterectomy, usually applied to animals.', ""Louisa Thompson's stunner of a set is another fine piece of dark absurdity. The script calls for Hester to be living under a bridge, but here she and the children dwell at the bottom of a trash heap and that trash heap is contained in what looks like a giant curved shovel blade, or perhaps the business end of a bulldozer. It extends the width of the stage and rises high enough for the actors to use it as a slide or a chalkboard or as a slippery prison wall over which Hester can never escape."", '(Stanford Friedman)', '""Suzan-Lori Parks\'s Fucking A, one of her two Scarlet Letter-inspired plays running in tandem at the Signature, keeps audiences at a Brechtian distance. Its sister show, In the Blood, seizes you from the get-go... Parks\'s scathing indictment of how society treats impoverished women gets your pulse pumping even as it breaks your heart.""', ' ', 'Raven Snook for Time Out New York', 'External links to full reviews from popular press...', 'Time Out'",0,None,"(None,)"
Appropriate,"Review by Tulis McCall', ""What is fascinating and brave about Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins' writing is that he is hauling old sins out into the light. I was speaking to some folks after seeing Appropriate at the Signature Theatre, and the particular sins, that Jacobs-Jenkins examined, seemed to be news to them. The matter of lynching, despicable in its own right, is laid out on the table in the form of a photo album. Lynchings were a social occasion that people documented. They brought their children to bear witness."", 'The metaphoric table on which this album is laid out belongs to the Lafayette family, who insert new colors to the rainbow of dysfunctional. The patriarch has died and the three siblings are reuniting just as the house, such as it is, is about to be auctioned off. The proceeds will do little more than wipe out the debt incurred by their father and Bo (Michale Laurence) who has been the main source of finances for the past few years. Toni (Johanna Day) has been the main source of elbow grease. She has been the one to visit every couple of weeks and see to it that her father and the caretaker were doing as well as could be while the house sort of collapsed around them.', ""As the play opens, Toni has been at it, sorting out the mountains and mountains of detritus that her father left behind. She is making little headway, even though her son Rhys (Mike Faist) is there to help. The people hired to take care of cataloging for the estate sale were ripping them off, says Toni. Bo and his wife Rachael (Maddie Corman) - who has a case of neat and tidy that would make your head explode - arrive with their two children, Cassidy (Izzy Hanson-Johnston) who is bursting into womanhood, and her younger brother Ainsley (Alex Dreier) who is basically there to create chaos. Unbeknownst to any of them, Toni and Bo's younger brother Frank (Patch Darragh) has returned the night before with his fiancée, River (Sonya Harum). Frank is the blackest of the family sheep, having been arrested for sleeping with a 13-year old, and spending many years addicted to whatever was available. He is sober now, and although no one has heard from him in 10 years, he is hoping for redemption and reconnection."", ""No one in this family likes one another. Well, the three siblings don't. They are tied by that string of gristle known as a gene pool, but every time they stick their hand in to the mix, someone bites it. Having recently gone through a parent's passing, I know how complicated the communication can get in situations like this. These three folks, however, are operating independent of one another. They talk, and react. They don't listen. Their collisions are like bumper cars at an amusement park. After a while, you just want someone to shut off the power and announce that the ride is over."", ""These are folks who don't need anything to help them explode, so when Jacobs-Jenkins tosses in the photo album of lynchings the situation becomes atomic. Not a one can believe that their father actually owned this object. Toni says he was too good. Frank says he was too unstable. Bo says he wasn't social enough to be part of the Klan. As each person comes into contact with this piece of historic kryptonite, the outer trappings disappear and we see them naked as the day they were born. Only Rachael and River seem to have escaped the gene pool mess and are in possession of a smidge of objectivity. When Bo is left grasping at any innocent reason why the book was in the house at all - maybe it was for the planned bed and breakfast? - Rachael replies Oh, really? For the special Klan room or the lynching suite?!"", ""The unfortunate part of this, for me, is that Jacobs-Jenkins doesn't choose one character to pull the plot along. The sibling trinity moves as one broken mass. No single person has a goal around which the story is built. Like its ancestors, this play furnishes each character with mighty (and beautifully performed, every single one) monologues that catalog the grievances each adult has tucked away in their memory bank. But to what purpose? The writing in the second act borders on sophomoric. Toni (who reveals in the last scene that she was looking forward to the weekend with her family - news to us) delivers a parting shot to her ... maybe that's all family is? Just a handful of stories that you tell yourself when you need an excuse - to explain how trapped you feel or broken or cheated?"", 'For me it is not enough to spend two hours watching disagreeable people bounce off one another. I experience that in ""real life"". I want my theatre to take real life and shift my perspective. I wanted Jacobs-Jenkins to go deep. I wanted him to take me into the basement of this family\'s house of cards and shine his unique light on what was there. He went wide. He painted in broad strokes - an equal opportunity observer. In spite of the excellent performances and the very fine direction by Liesl Tommy, not to mention the killer set by Clint Ramos, instead of being pulled into the Lafayette family basement, I was left out on the front lawn, asking the same question that Bo asked: Is there a point to all this?', ""I may be in the minority, however. The people with whom I spoke after the show didn't care about any of that play structure crap. They got the story and they thought it was a mighty one. End of conversation. One play seen by 100 people equals 100 different plays. It is part of the magic of theatre."", 'All things considered, I look forward to more work from Jacobs-Jenkins. He is an adventuresome chronicler. Bravo to that.', 'The only remaining question is: Is it Appropriate as in ""proper"" or Appropriate as in take something from someone for your own use? Hmmmmm...', '""Without forcing us, this remarkable and devious play allows us to draw our own parallels with the human sound and fury that fills most of the evening.""', ' ', 'Ben Brantley for New York Times', '""Too bad the virtues of this comedy-drama are hidden in director Liesl Tommy\'s miscalibrated production.""', ' ', 'Joe Dziemianowicz for New York Daily News', '""While there\'s very little that\'s fresh in \'Appropriate\', the show\'s still a fun ride.""', ' ', 'Elisabeth Vincentelli for New York Post', '""Viewers who appreciate a linear, old-school \'good story\' in the manner of \'August: Osage County\' are likely to enjoy the simmering domestic tensions and fights that are ably crafted by the playwright in numerous heated conflicts and acrid exchanges that culminate in a free-for-all brawl.""', ' ', 'Michael Sommers for Newsroom Jersey', 'External links to full reviews from popular press...', 'New York Times', ' - ', 'New York Daily News', ' - ', 'New York Post', ' - ', 'Newsroom Jersey'",0,None,"(None,)"

Review of Admissions by Joshua Harmon at Lincoln Center Theater,"Admissions', "", Joshua Harmon's interesting, if ultimately limited, discourse on the perils of white male privilege, is now playing at the "", 'Mitzi E. Newhouse', ' at Lincoln Center. The production, directed by Daniel Aukin, submits a compelling application for higher education without actually making it all the way out of prep school.', 'The action of the play takes place at and near Hillcrest, a New England boarding/prep school whose Headmaster, Bill Mason (', 'Andrew Garman', '), is married to the Admissions Director, Sherri Rosen-Mason (', 'Jessica Hecht', '). She has labored throughout her tenure at Hillcrest to increase the diversity of the predominantly white student body, and is finally enjoying the fruits of these efforts as the percentage of minority students for the incoming class has finally approached the 20% mark. That good news is overshadowed by the disappointing deferral letter her Hillcrest senior son Charlie (', 'Ben Edelman', ') has received from Yale, which he had set his heart upon, and the simultaneous acceptance into Yale by his best friend Perry, whose father is black. Charlie has also been overlooked for the Editor position at the school newspaper, which went to a female less qualified, and he is unable to synthesize his feelings of frustration and rejection with his liberal parents\' professional commitment to the values of affirmative action and inclusion. This interesting dilemma provokes an intense family outburst in the kitchen of the Mason home; naturally, his parents want what\'s best for him, but Charlie is throwing it right back at them. At one point, he says ""Can you honestly spare me your liberal guilty white bullshit for two seconds and hear what I\'m saying?"" They take it right on the chin, like the good liberal sorts that they are, as he goes on an extensive rant about the unfairness of the quota-reliant admissions system that they have helped to construct - for his own failure. Bill Mason tasks his son with being a privileged brat who has had everything handed to him, but when Charlie goes storming off to his room, his parents set to work on pulling strings to help him get into a good college. This ""liberal hypocrisy"" doesn\'t appear to work out terribly well, even when Charlie finally lands a slot at Middlebury College, because by that time Charlie has decided to go to a community college and have his parents donate the money that they would have spent on his education to create a scholarship for an under-privileged minority student.\xa0Charlie gets it: in order to give someone a seat at the table, someone else has to give up their place.\xa0That\'s not flying with his parents, though it would seem to be a living expression of everything they stand for, and upon this impasse this ultimately frustrating domestic drama ends, with Charlie storming off again to his room.', ""The cast is excellent, on the whole, though Mr. Edelman needs to master some vocal technique in order to make his way through his longer tirades; given at the decibel-splitting level he is attempting, I worry he won't make it through eight shows a week. "", 'Jessica Hecht', ' and ', 'Andrew Garman', ' deliver solid performances as the parents, and in crucial, smaller roles ', 'Ann McDonough', ' and ', 'Sally Murphy', "" lend credible veteran support.

Additionally, the play never seems to open itself up to the larger issues of race that it raises; this is a play specifically about white people and how they respond, or not, to the need to create a space at the table for those less fortunate. Joshua Harmon demonstrates great potential as an emerging playwright and writes intelligent, compelling dialogue, but you have to wonder why, in a play ostensibly about race, there is not one person of color in the cast?

Grace looks for the good while Vet looks for the borders. Borders define what is yours and what is mine. For Vet, pretty much everything falls into the ""what is mine"" category. Vet is a black sooty cloud in a Border Patrol uniform. The only light Grace has is in her secret book - the Book of Grace - that she has hidden under floorboards in the living room. In it she keeps scraps of stories about people saving people, lost animals returning home. The other little ray of hope is Buddy, Vet\'s son, who she has invited to visit on the occasion of Vet\'s getting an award for capturing aliens who were smuggling marijuana.', 'It has been 15 years since they have seen Buddy.

So when he does show up he is carrying a chip the size of Idaho on his shoulder and flashing an attitude that mirrors his father in more ways than one.', ""How this all plays out is fairly predictable. What is the delicious part is how Parks dishes it out. Buddy is more alien that the border crossers. He brings Vet's past transgressions, sins of omission and commission with him. He has few words and an equal number of actions (like the kiss he plants on his father for old time's sake). But each is enough to slide like a needle under Vet's skin. Enough of those and Vet is ready to pop."", ""Grace herself is ripe for the picking. She gives herself to Buddy with a mighty passion that she then buries along with her book.

Review of The Play That Goes Wrong at New World Stages,"Halfway through the first act of the hilarious off-Broadway staging of ', 'The Play That Goes Wrong', ', an actor who has grown wildly frustrated because of a missing prop turns to the audience and says, ""Stop laughing!

If it is cliché to say that a show has non-stop laughs, then this show is cliché in the extreme. If it is pat to say that this play lives up to its title, rarely have a talented crew of actors and technicians so seamlessly joined forces to make a ridiculously wrong piece of theater feel so very right.', 'The script, by a trio of gents who trained at the London Academy of Music & Dramatic Art, actually has a rather complicated exoskeleton. It is a play within a play, with actors portraying other actors who, in turn, are portraying characters in a murder mystery. It is an Agatha Christie type of an affair where one dead body turns into two, then back into one, then into several, while siblings, friends, a love interest and, of course, the butler, are all scrutinized by an intrepid inspector (a game for anything ', 'Matt Harrington', '). But none of this matters in the least. It is merely an excuse for two hours of well-timed spit takes, killer pratfalls, silly antics by men with serious British accents, pyrotechnics of both the literal and metaphorical variety, purposefully egregious over-acting and death defying moments of scenic design by Tony Award winner ', 'Nigel Hook', '.

It is a delightful depiction of teenage expectations and romance, and a stunning contrast to the wonderful 'Spring Awakening', another tale of teenage life in the same straight-laced period, which opened on Broadway just last week. And, like 'Spring Awakening', I highly recommend that you see it."", ""'In Meet Me in St. Louis', the children go to school but it is hardly ever mentioned (although the son does get into Princeton). The kids are also very well groomed--from the purple pinafore which Tootie, the youngest and cutest of the lot, wears to open the show, to the gorgeous red velvet ballgown worn by Esther (the Judy Garland role) at its climax. But they are not all goody-goodies. Some very nasty Halloween tricks are played. And their Dad is a bit of a benevolent despot. The two teenage daughtersï¿½Rose and Estherï¿½donï¿½t seem to worry about much except whom they are going to marry and whether they are going to have to move to awful New York and leave their friends.

The Piano Lesson,"This is a production of substance and grace. It is stacked with relationships so layered and family history branches so deep and convoluted that you practically need hip boots to wade on in to this tale. And wade on in you will definitely want to do. No question about that.', ""It is 1936 Pittsburgh. Boy Willie (Brandon J. Dirden) and his friend Lymon (Jason Dirden) have driven up from Mississippi, and the trip has taken them two days on account of their truck breaking down more than once. They arrive in the way early morning at the home that Boy Willie's sister Berniece (Roslyn Ruff) shares with their uncle Doaker (James A. Williams). Brother and sister have not seen one another in over three years, not since Berniece's husband died. The two travellers have great plans for the sale of their watermelons, and once they have the cash in hand Boy Willie plans to take possession of the piano, a family heirloom that he and his sister co-own, and sell it. With his share of the money he can buy his final piece of land back in Mississippi. Boy Willie has a chance to make a dream come true, and he is depending on his family to help make it happen."", ""Berniece, however, has no intention of letting this piano get out of the family. It has history and it has lessons carved into it. Her great-grandmother and grandfather were traded for that piano. It was her great grandfather who carved the history of his family into it at the request of his master Sutter, whose wife Ophelia had grown to regret the trade and wanted her slaves back. The new owner would not sell them, so the carving brought them back as close as it could. Years later, Berniece and Boy Willie's father, Charles, stole the piano back into the family."", 'This piano is not going anywhere.', ""So there you have it. An immovable meets an irresistible force. And we get to see the two collide. These two siblings are more than estranged - and the fact that Berniece's husband died as a result of a caper he shared with Boy Willie and Lymon just adds gasoline to the fire. These two siblings are in different solar systems, and the characters that surround their connection to each other are satellites of equal strength and variety."", ""Each character in this story is imbued with specificity and vibrance, and under the direction of Ruben Santiago-Hudson each is realized by a more than terrific cast. Brandon J. Dirden is a powerhouse as Boy Willie. Roslyn Ruff's Berniece is steady and made of steel she created herself in order to survive and pave a road for her daughter. Doaker lives a life of solitude and awareness, having lost his own marriage and watching humanity flow from point to point on the train where he works. James A. Williams provides gravitas and poignancy to Doaker. Chuck Cooper (Wining Boy - Doaker's brother) is expansive and generous in his portrayal of a man living day to day, with some serious consideration directed to his personal rear view mirror.

Spring Awakening, which just opened at the Eugene Oï¿½Neill, is all about subjects of more-than-passing concern to teens and college-age folks--explicit sex (or about as explicit as it gets on the Broadway stage), masturbation, drugs, corporal punishment, homosexuality, reform school, suicide and abortion. Itï¿½s not the treacly fare of musicals that are aimed at groups other than the Baby Boomers and even more senior seniors who buy most of the tickets these days.', 'Unlike the last big musical aimed at a similar young hip audience, Rent, which updated a famous tale about Paris bohemians of the 1830s to the East Village of the 1990s, Spring Awakening, which is based on an 1891 play by Frank Wedekind as filtered through a book by Steven Sater, is set superficially in a 19th-century provincial German town. However, the interior monologues of the various characters, set to a propulsive rock score by Duncan Sheik and lyrics by Mr. Sater, have a distinctly 21st century sensibility. Song titles like ï¿½The Bitch of Living,ï¿½ ï¿½My Junkï¿½ and ï¿½Totally Fuckedï¿½ tell the story. When cast members whip hand mikes out of their costumes to belt out such numbers, you know you are in for a potential clash of the old and the new. But it totally works. Existential angst is nothing new; we are now much better at acting it out.', 'The Atlantic Theater Companyï¿½s off-Broadway production of this show at its ex-church on West 20th Street last year made a big splash. The set of the current Broadway production by Christine Jones is a larger but exact replica of that one, right down to the gothic-arched entrances on the rear brick wall. The elaborate lighting by Kevin Adams has been deepened and enlarged since last year and is a very powerful element of the overall production. Michael Mayer has directed with clarity and precision and Bill T. Jones has infused the choreography with infectious energy despite a rather small playing space.', 'The younger members of the talented and committed cast led by Lea Michele, Jonathan Groff and John Gallagher, Jr. are carryovers from the off-Broadway production. The two ï¿½adultï¿½ cast members who play numerous (mostly villainous) roles--Christine Estabrook and Stephen Spinellaï¿½are new to the group but excellent. Spinella really knows how to fill out a frock coat and wield a cane.', ""Spring Awakening doesnï¿½t have a happy ending, but the issues it explores are universal and timeless.

And like all young people, they think they invented sex.', ""This cult of youth, with their easy public sexuality, dominate the magazines, the airwaves, and the movie industry, so it's a wonder 'Spring Awakening,' took so long to make its way to a Broadway stage. This hot new rock musical, based on German playwright Frank Wedekind's 1891 play 'The Awakening of Spring,' deals with the sexual stirrings of young teens and its consequences in a repressive society."", ""Breakthrough musicals are a rarity on Broadway, but 'Spring Awakening' is just that, with a script written from the teenagers' point of view, and rock music composed just for them, without so much as a nod to adult tastes. It is the teens who are leading the charge forward, and we must either follow, or be left behind to face an ever-widening generation gap."", ""All the adults in 'Spring Awakening' are played by Stephen Spinella and Christine Estabrook, two, well, adults and they are merely commodities, interchangeable beings whose function it is to thwart the lives of those youngsters who invented sex. They are portrayed as caricatures -- the strict teacher, the judgmental father, the over-protective mother -- with no quirks or idiosyncrasies to give them verisimilitude."", ""The teens, on the other hand, are all carefully drawn individuals, forced to cope with, not only sexual beginnings, but pregnancy, abortion and suicide. Their pain and confusion, which always accompany the lives of teens, fit well on this chaotically designed stage, with simulated sex, discreet nudity, dazzling lighting, and lots of rock music I could tolerate, but didn't love."", ""However, my friend Geri Manus, a former standup comic at Caroline's Comedy Club, teacher of Shakespeare, rock aficionado -- and 10 years younger than I -- has agreed to critique the music since I'd do a terrible job of it."", ""Geri here. If you were expecting an Andrew Lloyd Weber musical, this isn't it. This is 1890s Germany meets 21st Century America in all its profundity. From the minute the teens chant the Latin lessons in their sober German classroom, one knows they have to break through their constraints, as all teens have done before and since."", ""As the teenage angst builds, so does the driving beat of the impressive music and choreography. The dichotomy is noticeable and gives the musical its edge. The song, 'I Believe' could replace 'Seasons of Love' in many high school choirs. 'Bitch of Living' could be on the Billboard's Top 10 if released as a single, and one boy's agonizing 'I Don't Do Sadness' before his ultimate final act is reminiscent of Freddie Mercury's 'nothing really matters' refrain, probably the saddest of all the lyrics in Queen's megahit ,'Bohemian Rhapsody.'"", '""Spring Awakening"" is a tonic for this Broadway season and a reason to bring another generation into the theater.

The Way We Get By,"Review by ', 'Tulis McCall', ' 20 May 2015', 'There are times when Neil LaBute gets to me and times when he does not.', 'With The Way We Get By at Second Stage Theatre LaBute rang the bell on this one.', 'Doug (Thomas Sadoski) and Beth (Amanda Seyfried) are in post coital sturm and drang. Their decision to sleep together after they see each other once again at a wedding reception seemed like a good idea at the time. And there are remnants of that good idea still present in the wee small hours of the morning, but this ship is on seriously shakey ground.', ""This is one of those reviews where it is difficult to tell the who-what-when-where and WHY without doing a major spoiler alert. Let's just say that if you dig under the unique set of circumstances in which Beth and Doug find themselves you will come to the bedrock of this piece. In that bedrock, LaBute stakes out his claim to the singular and universal dilemma. When is it right to throw caution to the wind and leap off the edge of reality into what might be? How do you know if that person standing in front of you will not let go? What is worth that risk?"", 'Doug and Beth have been carrying around not only mucho baggage, but torches of enormous proportion for one another. Last night their physical desire overwrote their logic, if that is what a person could call it, and they satisfied themselves in every way. Now they are waiting for dawn to come up and for light to be shown on the subject. Some very, very serious light.', ""Like most LaBute tales this one starts out with jagged incomplete sentences that at first hang in the air like soggy bits of laundry. Once these two actors let go of the punctuation, however, they set sail with fireworks. Doug is the first to open the door to the kind of logic that says What ARE we doing here? Beth responds in Spades. The stakes, without having to be explained, are laid out by LaBute like morsels of a gourmet feast set down to lead us from one point to the next. While the characters stall out over and over, the story never does. These two dare, prod, and cajole one another to keep going. Don't drop the ball. Please stay with me. I am here. You can hear them saying what they are not saying. The facts of their tale spin out. Beth and Doug's passion for connection gets stronger and stronger."", 'As in other LaBute stories, these characters arrive fully formed and ready for full frontal heart to heart combat. Over the course of 80 or so minutes that fly by, LaBute turns up the temperature incrementally. He gives his characters time to listen, parry, act and react. He gives us time to be drawn into the basement of their story - which is where we want to be.', 'Leigh Silverman pulls the walls of life close in on Beth and Doug. They become sort of caged animals pacing inside her tiny apartment. Either could leave at any time. The door is open, it is clear. But that door leads to a life of getting by. These two know that life. It is killing them. So for these two people to stay in the room, to stay inside their own selves, to stay in connection with the other person who is pretty much tossing life as it was previously know right out the window - THIS is a a big deal. This is a risk and a sacrifice worth the bother.', 'And it is totally worth the watch. Bravo.

Big Love,"Review by ', 'Tulis McCall', ' 25 February 2015', ""Charles Mee lives on a planet very near the one that Bill Irwin calls home. I don't know where it is, but I do know I have visited it, several times. With Big Love now at the Pershing Square Signature Center, he has achieved lift-off once again."", ""Big Love is based on the The Danaids by Aeschylus. Fifty perspective brides are fleeing fifty pursuing grooms. In Mee's version, the time is the present and the place is a stunning location designed by Bret J. Banakis. It is white and clean and - I was about to say serene - but who are we kidding? Once the trio of sisters - Lydia (Rebecca Naomi Jones), Olympia (Libby Winters) and Thyona (Stacey Sargeant) - arrives on site, the serenity factor is exchanged for chaos. After a throbbing rendition of You Don't Own Me (I can only hope that Lesley Gore was listening form another plane) they meet the matriarch of the family, Bella (Lynne Cohen) who weaves a tale of her 13 sons that stops these women in their tracks."", 'Soon, the young man who originally met them , Giuliano (Preston Sadleir) returns with his uncle, the owner of the manse, Piero (Christopher Innvar) to give them haven. Consider us refugees, they tell him, from Greece. We are here and we need help. N-O-W. Who knows what will happen if you do not act????', 'When Piero leaves the women chant a diatribe against all men. They are a biological mistake and end up useless or devious, the women shout. Over this din comes a helicopter and very same men that these women loathe arrive on the scene by slithering down ropes. Nikos (Bobby Steggart), Constantine (Ryan-James Hatanaka) and Oes ( Emmanual Brown) have come to stake their claim in person. When the women do not succom to ""reason"" Constantine tells them:', '""The future is going to happen, Thyona,', ' whether you like it or not.', "" You say, you don't want to be taken against your will."", ' People are taken against their will every day"".', 'Piero returns and invites the men inside to work things out and the women go a little ballistic, hurling themselves about the stage in a most unladylike fashion. Soon we meet the weekend guests Ekeanor (Ellen Harvey) and Leo (Nathaniel Stampley) who need little encouragement to prepare for a wedding. Leo will even do duty as the father of a bride if called upon. These two are exuberant and oozing life with all its possibilities.', 'Time flies on. We hear of love unattained (Guliano) and love found and treasured (Bella). Lydia and Nikos find their way to one another - the other four not so much. The wedding is planned and carried out, the sisters agreeing that they will murder their husbands when the ceremony is over. Which is one way to get out of the deal. Wedding happens. Two of the three sisters keep their word. Lydia and Nikos are either smart or blind, depending on who is doing the talking. Bella winds up the evening with a loving treatise on loving:', '""For we all live together', ' and come to embrace', ' the splendid variety of life on earth', ' good and bad', ' sweet and sour', ' take it for what it is: the glory of life"".', 'Blessings are bestowed on anyone who will listen. We are encouraged to live and love and carry on. Flashbulbs for the group shot. The bouquet and garter are tossed into the audience. The wedding party leaves and we are left to screw our heads and hearts back into place. Because that is what Mee does. He switches your head and heart positions. And the best part is that you never QUITE get them back in place the way they were before. Excellent. Most excellent.', '(Tulis McCall)', '""Big Love fails to generate any genuine friction, never mind the expansive emotion promised by its title.

Avenue Q,"The New York Theatre Guide last reviewed the New York production of Avenue Q seven years ago, so we thought it was high time we re-visited Princeton, Kate Monster and co. at New World Stages to see if that fur-covered musical magic is still alive and well. I'm happy to report that Avenue Q is still right up my (Sesame) street!"", 'In 2003, this musical comedy from the creative genius of Jeff Whitty, Jeff Marx and the now EGOT-winner Robert Lopez defied all conventions and broke the mold of modern musical theatre. Shows that followed, including The Book of Mormon, tip their hats in appreciation for these brave puppets, who paved the way. Its snowballing success from the original 2003 production at the Vineyard Theatre swiftly led to a Broadway transfer to the John Golden Theatre, where it played an impressive total of 2,556 performance over more than six years. After closing on Broadway, it reopened the off-Broadway New World Stages venue in October 2009 and it is still entertaining crowds at that same venue today.', 'The beauty of Avenue Q is the fact that every single person in the audience on any given evening will relate to something on stage. Most of us are familiar to a certain extent with ""Sesame Street"" and will appreciate the obvious parodies, especially the short pieces of animation played on the screens at either side of the stage. Gone are the cartoons about simple mathematical sums, however, as we find ourselves chuckling at videos about \'one night stands.\' And seeing humans living in harmony (or disharmony) together on the same street joyously awakens the child within. But then, you are reminded how adult you have become, absorbing musical numbers about pornography, homosexuality, racism and that quest we all undertake on a daily basis - finding your purpose in life.', 'This clever cast of characters are ticking every box, we might be struggling with in our own lives. Whether it be unemployment, being single, or coming to terms with your sexuality, the chances are you will leave the theatre having completely identified with another human... or a puppet (and how often can you say that?!)', ""Although the show is over 13 years old by now, its essence refuses to grow thin over time, providing you have a talented cast to carry the script's humour and belt out those cheeky, politically incorrect tunes. In the case of the New World Stage cast, they certainly hit the mark."", 'A special mention goes to Elizabeth Ann Berg and Grace Choi for their performances as Kate Monster / Lucy the Slut and Christmas Eve, respectively. Although the ensemble cast has great chemistry and comic timing, these two performers were vocally on top notch last night, bringing the house down with the power ballad ""The More You Ruv Someone"" and the heart-warming ""There\'s a Fine, Fine Line.""', ""Simply put, this show is a perfect choice for visitors in town, who would like a sample of New York 'real' life, led by the not-so-real neighbours of Avenue Q. We may all be wondering how the hell we got to this point in our lives and constantly questioning what our purpose is? But for now, I'm happy that a single evening's purpose is well spent just to sit back, laugh and rejoice at the marvel of this modern-day musical."", '(Photo by Carol Rosegg)', '""They may have no legs of their own, but darned if those fuzzy creatures aren\'t still standing, long after more full-bodied competition has bitten the dust.""', 'Ben Brantley for the New York Times', '""Avenue Q is still one of the hippest theatrical destinations in New York""', 'David Sheward for Back Stage', '""Returning to its Off Broadway origins, the 2004 Tony winner shows no discernible signs of downsizing and no loss of heart.""', 'David Rooney for Variety', 'New York Times', ' - ', 'Back Stage', ' - ', 'Variety'",5,Excellent,(Photo by Carol Rosegg)
The Woodsman,"Review by ', 'Daniel Dunlow', ' 14 February 2016', ""Brave, courageous, and full of heart. There's no play like The Woodsman. There's no play like The Woodsman. There's no play like The Woodsman."", 'Now that the The Wizard of Oz puns are out of the way, opening up at New World Stages is incredibly innovative new play The Woodsman which tells the story of the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz in his transition from man who chops down trees to becoming the rusted, metal creature in the woods that we all know from the indelible L. Frank Baum novel, and subsequent movie. You may be thinking to yourself that this is ultimately what that long-running Broadway ""gem"" Wicked is about; and you\'re right. However, there is one major difference. The Woodsman succeeds in pure, simple, and concise story telling without the use of words. That\'s right. Just a monologue or two of text in this 70-minute powerhouse, and the audience stays glued to the story like a Charlie Chaplin film.', 'The story is told masterfully through physical acting, clowning, music, and beautiful puppetry. Though this may sound like a Ringling Brothers routine, it has the theatrical precision of a Sondheim, the heart of a Tennessee Williams, and the drama of an Arthur Miller.', 'The design of the production by James Oritz (who also wrote and co-directed) is seamlessly integrated into performance, drawing our minds back to ""found-prop"" theatre techniques developed and used so beautiful by Peter and the Starcatcher. Wooden crates become walls, trees, and chairs, while company members give character to the most mundane everyday objects such as spoons, books, and sticks.', 'The company quite literally breathes life into this production, and in that they are flawless. They work together to give life to puppets controlled by more than one company member, they play three of four characters within the minute of stage time, and they leave it all out on the stage in this hour-long tour-de-force. This is all thanks to some of the most innovative direction by James Ortiz and Claire Karpen. They create potent poetic and dramatic moments that cannot be seen on any other New York stage today.', ""The storytelling that occurs without text is so clear that in a split instant something so true can happen that it brings the audience to tears. I'll be honest, I had to wipe tears from my eyes- not because something tragic had happened, but because something so pure, simple, and honest occurred on the stage."", 'Simplicity is activated in its greatest from over at New World Stages in this production. See this once-in-a-lifetime theatrical experience.', '(Daniel Dunlow)', '""Although the narrative is diffusely conveyed at times, many of the individual sequences are vividly rendered, most notably Chopper\'s gruesome transformation into the Tin Man.""', ' ', 'Frank Scheck for Hollywood Reporter', '""The puppeteers are proficient and the effects are exquisite...the life-sized tin puppet of the woodsman (tenderly manipulated by Ortiz) is heartbreaking.""', ' ', 'Marilyn Stasio for Variety', 'External links to full reviews from popular press...', 'Hollywood Reporter', ' - ', 'Variety'",0,None,"(None,)"
